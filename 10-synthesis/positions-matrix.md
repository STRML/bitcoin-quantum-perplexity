## How to Read This Matrix

**Urgency Level** reflects the person's stated or implied view on how soon Bitcoin must act — not a prediction of when quantum computers will arrive. Someone rated "Low" may still acknowledge the theoretical threat while judging it decades away.

**Preferred Solution / Approach** is the person's documented technical or policy preference, not necessarily what they have publicly committed to implementing.

**Commercial Interest?** is applied honestly to all sides. This column does not imply bad faith — it documents structural incentives that are relevant to calibrating any public statement:
- A person who benefits financially from urgency narratives (PQC vendors, quantum startups, urgency-adjacent VC) is noted.
- A person who benefits from the status quo (CEO of a company with ECDSA-based product infrastructure) is also noted.
- A person with reputational investment in a specific proposal (BIP authorship) is noted.
- Independent researchers or commentators with no obvious financial stake are marked "None apparent."

**Key Source** links to the most specific, primary-source URL from the corpus for that person's documented position. Do not fabricate or extend these URLs.

## Notable Patterns

**Commercial incentives correlate strongly with urgency positions — in both directions.** The most alarmed public voices (Charles Edwards/Capriole, Nic Carter/Castle Island, Alex Pruden/Project Eleven, BTQ Technologies) all have direct financial stakes in the quantum threat being credible and near-term. This does not make their technical claims wrong, but it creates a structural bias worth flagging: urgency is good for their businesses. In the opposite direction, Adam Back (Blockstream CEO) publicly dismisses the threat while his company maintains ECDSA-based Bitcoin infrastructure, and Michael Saylor — holding 717,722 BTC — has enormous financial incentive to characterize quantum risk as distant. CoinShares manages Bitcoin investment products and publishes the most conservative exposure estimate (10,200 BTC at real risk) while explicitly framing the threat as "manageable." The pattern holds across the spectrum: participants with financial skin in the game cluster predictably around positions that benefit their holdings. The clearest exceptions — those most credibly free of commercial distortion — are the academic and non-profit voices: MIT DCI (Heilman, Dryja), Chaincode Labs (Milton/Shikhelman), and independent Core contributors such as Corallo, who takes a moderate "prepare but don't panic" position with no identifiable financial stake in the outcome.

**The Blockstream internal tension is the most analytically significant anomaly in the debate.** Adam Back, as CEO, has been the single loudest dismissive voice — calling urgency advocates "uninformed noise" and putting the threat at "20–40 years, if then." Yet his own organization's research team has produced more original quantum-resistance work than any other entity in the Bitcoin ecosystem: Tim Ruffing published the formal proof of Taproot's post-quantum security; Jonas Nick and Mikhail Kudinov designed SHRINCS (the most compact hash-based scheme proposed to date) and proposed OP_SHRINCSVERIFY; and Blockstream Research co-authored the comprehensive "Hash-based Signatures for Bitcoin" report. Nic Carter has publicly argued that Back's "uninformed noise" characterization "undermines the credibility" of his own researchers' output. The most plausible interpretation is that Back's public posture serves a different function than his research program: the public statements manage market sentiment and customer confidence in existing ECDSA-based products, while the internal research hedges against the scenario where the threat is real. This split between institutional messaging and technical output makes Blockstream's researchers (Nick, Ruffing, Kudinov) among the most credible voices on the technical merits, precisely because their work runs counter to their CEO's public narrative.

**Timeline skepticism among Core developers correlates with governance conservatism, not technical incompetence.** Pieter Wuille, the single most technically authoritative figure in Bitcoin protocol development, is genuinely skeptical of near-term urgency — yet he has also stated clearly that if a CRQC materializes, "the ecosystem has no other option" than freezing quantum-vulnerable coins. Peter Todd and Luke Dashjr are more dismissive. The pattern here is not ignorance but ideology: Core's dominant epistemology is "show me the concrete evidence before activating a change." This is a principled position in a system where premature upgrades are costly and irreversible. The danger is structural: Bitcoin's evidence-first governance norm creates a potential gap between when a credible quantum threat is detectable and when the network could complete a migration — a gap that Chaincode Labs estimates at 7–10 years. Even if every skeptic immediately converted to urgency advocates the moment a CRQC was proven, the migration timeline would already be determined by the work not yet started. This asymmetry between detection time and response time is the core argument of the urgency camp — and it is one that the "no urgency" camp's own timeline estimates don't fully refute.
