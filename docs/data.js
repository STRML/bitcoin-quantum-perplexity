  "00-INDEX": "# Bitcoin Quantum Threat Research Corpus\n## Master Index\n\n*Last updated: February 28, 2026*  \n*Total files: 32 (plus this index)*  \n*Total estimated words: ~75,500 (excluding this index)*  \n*Compiled: February 28, 2026*\n\n---\n\n## How to Use This Corpus\n\n**Who this is for.** This corpus is designed for three audiences: (1) Bitcoin protocol developers evaluating quantum-resistance proposals and needing to understand both the threat and the solution space; (2) quantum computing researchers who want to understand how their hardware progress maps to real-world cryptographic consequences for Bitcoin; and (3) policy, governance, and investment professionals who need a structured understanding of the threat timeline, community debate, and key actors without necessarily reading every technical deep-dive.\n\n**How it is organized.** The corpus is divided into eight topical directories plus this index and an open questions file. Each directory can be read independently, but the files are heavily cross-referenced. The recommended entry points differ by audience \u2014 see the suggested reading orders below.\n\n**A note on currency.** All files reflect the state of knowledge as of late February 2026. The quantum computing hardware landscape and the Bitcoin protocol discussion are both moving rapidly. Key sentinel events to watch for that would require updating this corpus are listed in [09-open-questions/open-questions.md](./09-open-questions/open-questions.md).\n\n**Staleness policy.** This corpus should be considered authoritative for approximately 6\u201312 months from its compilation date (February 28, 2026). After that period, key sections \u2014 particularly quantum hardware status (01-threat-model/quantum-hardware-status.md), BIP-360 progress (03-proposals-and-bips/bip-catalog.md), and timeline estimates (07-timeline-and-risk/) \u2014 should be audited against current developments. Specific update triggers that should prompt an immediate revision:\n\n| Trigger Event | Sections Requiring Update |\n|---|---|\n| Any quantum hardware milestone exceeding 100 logical qubits | 01-threat-model/quantum-hardware-status.md, 07-timeline-and-risk/ |\n| BIP-360 Bitcoin Core implementation PR filed | 03-proposals-and-bips/bip-catalog.md, 07-timeline-and-risk/bitcoin-migration-timeline.md |\n| FIPS 206 (FN-DSA / FALCON) finalized | 04-signature-schemes/falcon.md, 04-signature-schemes/comparison-matrix.md |\n| OP_CAT (BIP-347) activation or rejection | 03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md |\n| OPNEXT 2026 conference results (April 2026) | 04-signature-schemes/lamport-and-hash-based.md, 06-people-and-orgs/ |\n| Any demonstrated quantum factoring of keys > 50 bits | All threat model and timeline files |\n| Satoshi-era coins moving on-chain | 01-threat-model/vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md, 08-community-sentiment/ |\n\nBTC price figures cited in risk estimates are illustrative and should not be relied upon for current valuations.\n\n**A note on source quality.** Each file attempts to distinguish between peer-reviewed academic sources, technical reports from named research organizations, developer statements from mailing lists and public forums, and general media/analyst commentary. The distinction matters \u2014 some widely-cited numbers (e.g., \"6.9 million BTC at risk\") vary substantially depending on what counting methodology is used. When numbers conflict, this corpus traces them to their primary source.\n\n---\n\n## Corpus Map\n\n### Directory 01: Threat Model\n\n| File | Title | One-Line Description | Key Cross-References |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [01-threat-model/shor-vs-ecdsa.md](./01-threat-model/shor-vs-ecdsa.md) | Shor's Algorithm vs. Bitcoin's ECDSA | How Shor's algorithm breaks secp256k1 ECDLP;

Each is sourced to the file(s) where it is documented in detail.\n\n**1. Shor's algorithm is a complete, practical break of Bitcoin's ECDSA \u2014 not a theoretical risk.** A fault-tolerant quantum computer with approximately 2,330 logical qubits running Shor's algorithm could derive any Bitcoin private key from the corresponding public key. Every paper in the academic literature agrees on this theoretical claim. The debate is about *when* such a computer will exist, not *whether* the attack is valid. See [01-threat-model/shor-vs-ecdsa.md](./01-threat-model/shor-vs-ecdsa.md) and [02-academic-research/key-findings-synthesis.md](./02-academic-research/key-findings-synthesis.md).\n\n**2. An estimated 6.26\u20136.9 million BTC is currently held in quantum-vulnerable addresses.** This includes ~1.72 million BTC in P2PK outputs (predominantly Satoshi's coins, with permanently exposed public keys), ~4.49 million BTC in reused P2PKH addresses (where spending history revealed public keys), and ~146,715\u2013196,292 BTC in Taproot outputs (which embed a tweaked public key in every scriptPubKey). The exact figure varies by methodology, but the order of magnitude is consistent across sources. See [01-threat-model/vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md](./01-threat-model/vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md).\n\n**3. Bitcoin's SHA-256 proof-of-work is substantially more quantum-resistant than its signature scheme.** Grover's algorithm provides only a quadratic speedup (not the polynomial speedup of Shor's) against SHA-256, reducing effective security from 256 bits to 128 bits \u2014 still practically unbreakable. Mining centralization from quantum ASICs is a theoretical concern but is not the priority threat. See [01-threat-model/grover-vs-sha256.md](./01-threat-model/grover-vs-sha256.md).\n\n**4. Current quantum hardware is approximately 50\u00d7 short of the Bitcoin threat threshold.** The best publicly demonstrated logical qubit count is 48 (Quantinuum Helios, November 2025). IBM's Blue Jay system (targeting 2033) aims for ~2,000 logical qubits \u2014 approaching but not necessarily exceeding the 2,330 threshold. A positive risk window \u2014 where a CRQC arrives before Bitcoin completes its migration \u2014 is the most probable outcome under current trajectories. See [01-threat-model/quantum-hardware-status.md](./01-threat-model/quantum-hardware-status.md) and [07-timeline-and-risk/gap-analysis.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/gap-analysis.md).\n\n**5. NIST has finalized three post-quantum signature standards (FIPS 204, 205, and draft 206) that could protect Bitcoin.** ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium), SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+), and FN-DSA (FALCON) are the three NIST-selected schemes and are all included in BIP-360's `libbitcoinpqc` library. They differ dramatically in signature size (666 bytes to 49,856 bytes), cryptographic assumptions (lattice vs. hash-only), and implementation complexity. No single scheme is dominant across all Bitcoin-relevant dimensions. See [04-signature-schemes/comparison-matrix.md](./04-signature-schemes/comparison-matrix.md).\n\n**6. BIP-360 (Pay-to-Merkle-Root, P2MR) was merged into the Bitcoin BIP repository on February 11, 2026 \u2014 but this is documentation, not activation.** BIP-360 creates a new SegWit v2 output type that hides public keys in a Merkle tree root, addressing long-exposure quantum attacks on Taproot. It does not introduce PQ signature opcodes (that is deferred to follow-on BIPs) and does not address short-exposure attacks during the mempool window. No Bitcoin Core implementation PR exists as of February 2026. See [03-proposals-and-bips/bip-catalog.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/bip-catalog.md).\n\n**7. Full quantum migration of Bitcoin is estimated to take 7\u201315+ years from the point of community consensus.** Ethan Heilman's \"optimistic\" estimate is 7 years (2.5 years development, 6 months activation, 4+ years ecosystem migration). The JBBA analysis estimates 10\u201315 years under \"normal Bitcoin governance friction\" and notes the most likely outcome is \"stalls until a quantum computer is demonstrated.\" Historical precedent \u2014 SegWit took 7 years from concept to near-complete adoption \u2014 supports the longer estimate. See [07-timeline-and-risk/bitcoin-migration-timeline.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/bitcoin-migration-timeline.md).\n\n**8. The Bitcoin developer community is deeply divided, primarily on timeline urgency \u2014 not on whether the threat is real.** The spectrum runs from Charles Edwards (\"we have to fix this next year, or bon voyage\") to Adam Back (\"probably not for 20\u201340 years, if then\"). Most credentialed technical voices occupy the middle ground: \"within a decade\" (Matt Corallo), \"within the next decade\" (Chaincode Labs). The community broadly agrees quantum is a real future threat; the disagreement is about how urgently to act now. See [06-people-and-orgs/debate-map.md](./06-people-and-orgs/debate-map.md) and [08-community-sentiment/notable-threads-and-posts.md](./08-community-sentiment/notable-threads-and-posts.md).\n\n**9. Satoshi's ~1.1 million BTC in P2PK addresses is the single most politically explosive unresolved question in the corpus.** These coins are permanently quantum-vulnerable, likely lost (no movement in 15+ years), and worth approximately $90\u2013110 billion at 2026 prices. A quantum thief stealing them would constitute observable proof of a successful attack, likely triggering market panic. But freezing or burning them via protocol changes raises fundamental questions about property rights and Bitcoin's immutability. No consensus on what to do exists. See [01-threat-model/vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md](./01-threat-model/vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md) and [09-open-questions/open-questions.md](./09-open-questions/open-questions.md).\n\n**10. A working proof-of-concept quantum-safe Bitcoin testnet exists.** BTQ Technologies launched the Bitcoin Quantum testnet on January 12, 2026, replacing ECDSA with ML-DSA (FIPS 204) and using 64 MiB blocks to accommodate the larger signature sizes. This is the only live demonstration of a working quantum-resistant Bitcoin-compatible network, though the 64 MiB block size would be politically untenable on Bitcoin mainnet.

  "01-threat-model/grover-vs-sha256": "# Grover's Algorithm vs. Bitcoin's Hash Functions\n\n\n> **Last updated:** February 28, 2026 | **Confidence shelf-life:** 2 years (theoretical result, stable)\n\n\n*Part of the Bitcoin Quantum Threat Corpus \u2014 Phase 1a: Threat Model*\n\n**See also:**\n- [Shor's Algorithm vs. ECDSA](./shor-vs-ecdsa.md)\n- [Vulnerable vs Safe UTXOs](./vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md)\n- [Quantum Hardware Status](./quantum-hardware-status.md)\n- [Signature Scheme Comparison](../04-signature-schemes/comparison-matrix.md)\n\n---\n\n## 1. Grover's Algorithm: Quadratic, Not Exponential Speedup\n\nIn 1996, Lov Grover published a quantum algorithm for searching an unstructured database of N items in O(\u221aN) time, compared to the classical O(N) expected time. This is a **quadratic speedup** \u2014 not the exponential speedup that Shor's algorithm provides for factoring and discrete logarithms.\n\nThe distinction is critical. For Bitcoin:\n\n- **Shor's algorithm** reduces ECDLP from O(2^128) classical steps to O(n\u00b3) polynomial steps \u2014 a practical **total break** of ECDSA.\n- **Grover's algorithm** reduces SHA-256 preimage search from O(2^256) classical steps to O(2^128) quantum steps \u2014 a **security halving**, not a break.\n\nAs [PostQuantum.com explains](https://postquantum.com/post-quantum/grovers-algorithm/) (September 2025): \"Shor's algorithm is a far greater immediate threat to current cryptosystems because it can completely break RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and elliptic-curve cryptography in polynomial time. Grover's algorithm, while a threat, only weakens symmetric algorithms by a known factor (essentially requiring doubling key lengths), which is manageable.\"\n\nThe [National Academies of Sciences (2019)](https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/25196/chapter/6) frames the mitigation: \"Even if a computer existed that could run Grover's algorithm to attack AES-GCM, the solution is quite simple: increase the key size of AES-GCM from 128-bit to 256-bit keys.\"\n\n---\n\n## 2. Impact on SHA-256: Bitcoin Mining\n\nBitcoin's proof-of-work mechanism requires miners to find a nonce such that:\n\n```\nSHA-256(SHA-256(block_header)) < target\n```\n\nThis is an unstructured search problem \u2014 find a nonce among ~2^32 to 2^76 possible values (depending on difficulty). Grover's algorithm can theoretically search this space in O(\u221aN) quantum oracle calls instead of O(N) classical hash attempts.\n\n**The security reduction:**\nSHA-256 outputs 256-bit hashes. Grover's reduces the effective preimage resistance from **256 bits to 128 bits**. In raw numbers: a classical brute-force requires 2^256 hash evaluations; a quantum attacker using Grover's needs only 2^128.\n\nHowever, [Chainalysis (November 2025)](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/quantum-computing-crypto-security/) notes: \"the practical impact would be reducing SHA-256's 256-bit security to 128 bits \u2014 a significant reduction, but not a complete compromise of the system.\" The [CoinShares report (February 2026)](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/) concurs: \"128-bit security still renders brute-force attacks impractical due to enormous computational demands.\"\n\nTo calibrate: 2^128 \u2248 3.4 \u00d7 10^38 operations. Even at a trillion operations per second, this would take approximately 10^19 years \u2014 more than a billion times the age of the universe.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why 128-Bit Security Remains Adequate\n\nThe cryptographic community maintains broad consensus that **128-bit quantum security is the minimum acceptable standard** for the foreseeable future:\n\n- **NIST's position**: NIST's IR 8547 (December 2024) classifies algorithms with \u2265128-bit quantum security as acceptable through 2035, per [PQShield's analysis](https://pqshield.com/nist-recommends-timelines-for-transitioning-cryptographic-algorithms/).\n- **NSA's Suite B**: The NSA moved from SHA-256 to SHA-384 in its cryptographic suite \u2014 not because SHA-256 is broken, but to ensure margin above 128-bit post-quantum security.\n- **PostQuantum.com (2025)** [confirms](https://postquantum.com/post-quantum/grovers-algorithm/): \"128-bit post-quantum security is still considered strong. NSA and NIST consider AES-256 to be safe against quantum attacks precisely because Grover's reduces AES-256 to 128-bit strength, which is still strong.\" A 6,000-qubit quantum computer running Grover's optimally would require ~10^32 years to exhaust AES-256 \u2014 vastly exceeding the age of the universe.\n\nThe [Bitcoin Magazine foundational analysis](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-is-not-quantum-safe-and-how-we-can-fix-1375242150) summarizes: \"Grover's algorithm does not offer anything close to so drastic a speedup [as Shor's]. Rather, it simply provides a modest reduction from O(2^k) to O(2^(k/2)).\"\n\n---\n\n## 4. Impact on RIPEMD-160: Address Derivation\n\nBitcoin's legacy address system (P2PKH, P2SH) derives addresses via:\n\n```\naddress = Base58Check(RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(public_key)))\n```\n\nRIPEMD-160 produces 160-bit digests. Grover's algorithm reduces the effective security of RIPEMD-160 from **160 bits to 80 bits**.\n\nThis means an attacker trying to reverse a Bitcoin address to find the corresponding public key needs approximately 2^80 \u2248 1.2 \u00d7 10^24 quantum operations, versus 2^160 classically. As [Balaji Srinivasan's analysis notes](https://balajis.com/p/public-key-cryptography): \"a 160-bit hash function would still provide 80-bit security, even against a quantum computer, which is still pretty good.\"\n\n**Is 80-bit security sufficient?** This is more contested:\n- **Short-term**: 80-bit security is well above any practical attack. The [Bitcoin Magazine analysis (2013, still technically relevant)](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-is-not-quantum-safe-and-how-we-can-fix-1375242150) calculated that finding a public key from a Bitcoin address via Grover's would require ~1.2 \u00d7 10^24 steps \u2014 in the \"trillions of trillions of computations\" regime, still practically insurmountable.\n- **Long-term concern**: 80-bit security is below NIST's 112-bit minimum for new system designs (deprecated by 2030 per NIST IR 8547). If quantum hardware scales dramatically, 80-bit attacks become conceivable in the 2040s\u20132050s timeframe.\n- **Key context**: The 80-bit RIPEMD-160 weakness only matters for **unspent addresses where the public key has never been revealed**. Once the public key is exposed, the much more severe Shor's algorithm attack on ECDSA dominates. RIPEMD-160's 80-bit weakness is the secondary, more distant threat.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Grover's Practical Limitations for Bitcoin Mining\n\nDespite the theoretical quadratic speedup, several practical obstacles make Grover-powered quantum mining extraordinarily difficult:\n\n### 5.1 Circuit Depth and T-Gate Count\n\nGrover's oracle requires implementing SHA-256 as a quantum circuit. SHA-256's internal structure (64 rounds, bitwise operations, additions mod 2^32) translates to a very deep quantum circuit with enormous T-gate counts. The [National Academies report (2019)](https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/25196/chapter/6) notes that \"the overhead of implementing Grover's algorithm using physical qubits to solve the proof-of-work challenge is currently estimated to require well over 10 minutes\" per oracle call \u2014 which would exceed the block time before a single Grover iteration completed.\n\n### 5.2 Parallelization Limits\n\nA critical but often overlooked constraint: **Grover's algorithm does not parallelize like classical mining**. Classical mining benefits from near-perfect linear scaling \u2014 doubling hash rate halves expected time to find a block. Grover's algorithm, however, requires sequential quantum iterations; dividing the work across M quantum computers reduces runtime only by \u221aM, not M. As the [Roskilde University study (February 2026)](https://rucforsk.ruc.dk/ws/files/112173646/Group_10_Bitcoin_Final.pdf) found: \"increasing the number of qubits beyond a certain threshold does not yield additional acceleration due to the algorithmic limits of Grover's search.\"\n\n### 5.3 The Classical ASIC Comparison\n\nModern Bitcoin ASICs execute SHA-256 at extraordinary speeds with extreme energy efficiency. For a quantum miner to outperform an ASIC, it would need not just quadratic speedup in step count, but also faster clock speeds and comparable energy economics. The [CoinShares report (February 2026)](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/) concludes: \"whether [a quantum computer] would be economical compared to ASICs is entirely unclear.\"\n\n### 5.4 The Simulated Mining Paradox\n\nA counterintuitive result from [the Roskilde University simulation (2026)](https://rucforsk.ruc.dk/ws/files/112173646/Group_10_Bitcoin_Final.pdf): under Grover's algorithm, **higher mining difficulty actually reduces quantum mining time**. This occurs because difficulty determines the search space size N; higher difficulty lowers the numeric target, which shrinks N, and Grover's requires \u221aN steps. This inverse relationship \u2014 absent in classical mining \u2014 means quantum and classical miners respond to difficulty changes in opposite ways, fundamentally altering the economics.\n\nThe same simulation found that \"even under optimistic assumptions (a 216-qubit machine executing one Grover oracle call per nanosecond), the absolute time to mine a block remains on the order of years \u2014 far slower than today's classical global hash-rate performance.\"\n\n---\n\n## 6. The Difficulty Adjustment Argument\n\nEven if a quantum miner existed with a significant Grover-derived advantage, Bitcoin's **automatic difficulty adjustment** mechanism would neutralize the network-level threat:\n\n- Bitcoin adjusts mining difficulty every 2,016 blocks (~2 weeks) to maintain a 10-minute average block time.\n- If a quantum miner began finding blocks faster, difficulty would increase, requiring more hash power from all participants.\n- The quantum miner's advantage compresses but does not disappear; however, it would not enable a 51% attack unless the quantum miner controlled a majority of effective hash rate.\n- The [CoinShares analysis (2026)](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/) states explicitly: \"as for mining, a quantum computer could potentially be a rather fast mining computer, but whether it would be economical compared to ASICs is entirely unclear (and also unimportant given the automatic difficulty adjustment embedded into Bitcoin).\"\n\nThe [Investing.com analysis (February 2026)](https://www.investing.com/analysis/bitcoin-faces-the-quantum-countdown-200674443) raises a secondary concern: Grover's advantage could contribute to **mining centralization** if a single actor with quantum hardware gains disproportionate block production rights, creating potential for transaction censorship or block reorganizations. However, this is widely considered a distant concern relative to the Shor's/ECDSA vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n## 7. The \"Quantum Mining Doesn't Break Bitcoin\" Consensus\n\nThe academic and industry consensus is clear: Grover's algorithm applied to SHA-256 mining does not constitute an existential threat to Bitcoin, for three compounding reasons:\n\n| Limitation | Effect |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Only quadratic speedup (not exponential) | 2^128 operations still required for SHA-256 preimage |\n| Deep circuit requirements | Oracle execution may exceed block time |\n| Difficulty adjustment | Network-level compensation if quantum miners emerge |\n| Classical ASIC competition | Economics unclear vs. purpose-built hardware |\n\nThe [National Academies (2019)](https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/25196/chapter/6) concludes that the overhead for Grover-based proof-of-work attacks \"would make the attack a nonthreat to the current Bitcoin ecosystem\" even if fault-tolerant quantum computers become available, unless overheads are \"significantly reduced.\"\n\nThe genuine threat to Bitcoin from quantum computing is **entirely concentrated in Shor's algorithm breaking ECDSA** \u2014 not Grover's algorithm affecting hash functions. As [Bitcoin Magazine's analysis](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-is-not-quantum-safe-and-how-we-can-fix-1375242150) explains: \"it is the easy challenge of cracking elliptic curve cryptography with Shor's algorithm that is the bottleneck\" \u2014 Grover's impact on hash functions, while real, is a manageable secondary concern.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Summary: Grover's Impact on Bitcoin Hash Functions\n\n| Hash Function | Current Security | Post-Grover Security | Impact |\n|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|--------|\n| SHA-256 (mining) | 256-bit | 128-bit | Significant reduction; still secure |\n| SHA-256 (address generation) | 256-bit | 128-bit | Adequate for foreseeable future |\n| RIPEMD-160 (address) | 160-bit | 80-bit | Borderline; below NIST 2030 minimum |\n| Double-SHA-256 (TXID) | 256-bit | 128-bit | Secure; collision resistance unbroken |\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n1.

The Critical Gap: Where We Are vs. Where We Need to Be\n\nThe key reference metric for Bitcoin's threat is the **Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC)**: a fault-tolerant quantum computer capable of running Shor's algorithm on 256-bit elliptic curve cryptography within a practically useful timeframe.\n\nPer [Roetteler et al. (2017)](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180336015A1/en), breaking ECDSA-256 requires approximately **2,330 logical qubits**. Under [Webber et al.'s (2022)](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/physics/iqt/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Webber-2022.pdf) physical qubit estimates with surface code error correction:\n\n- **1-day attack**: ~13 million physical qubits\n- **1-hour attack**: ~317 million physical qubits\n- **10-minute (mempool) attack**: ~1.9 billion physical qubits\n\nAs of early 2026, the world's largest superconducting quantum processors contain **~1,000\u20134,000 physical qubits** \u2014 roughly **3 to 4 orders of magnitude** short of the 1-day attack requirement. Every major leading hardware system is reviewed below.\n\n---\n\n## 2. IBM Quantum\n\n### Current Hardware (2025\u20132026)\n\nIBM's active quantum computing hardware as of 2025\u20132026 includes:\n\n- **IBM Condor** (2023): 1,121 physical qubits \u2014 world's first >1,000-qubit superconducting processor. Demonstrated architectural scaling but with reduced per-qubit performance.\n- **IBM Heron** (2024\u20132025): 133\u2013156 qubits per chip, but with substantially improved gate fidelities (~99.9% two-qubit) vs. Condor. Heron is IBM's primary performance chip.\n- **IBM Nighthawk** (2025, announced): 120-qubit processor with improved crosstalk avoidance (L-coupling), designed for systematic scaling through 2028.\n\nPer [Tom's Hardware (February 2026)](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/the-future-of-quantum-computing-the-tech-companies-and-roadmaps-that-map-out-a-coherent-quantum-future), IBM plans to scale Nighthawk across 9 linked chips by 2027 (1,080 qubits) and up to 15,000-gate depth by 2028.\n\nIBM states on its own records: \"In the past decade, we have deployed more than 60 quantum devices (<100 qubits) and 24 quantum computers (>100 qubits) in data centers,\" per [LinkedIn/IBM (July 2025)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jackkrupansky_ibm-lays-out-clear-path-to-fault-tolerant-activity-7346135508952969216-tbrZ).\n\n### IBM's Roadmap\n\nIBM has the most detailed public roadmap in the industry, per [PostQuantum.com's IBM analysis (September 2025)](https://postquantum.com/quantum-computing-companies/ibm/):\n\n| Year | System | Physical Qubits | Logical Qubits | Key Milestone |\n|------|--------|----------------|----------------|---------------|\n| 2023 | Condor | 1,121 | \u2014 | First >1K qubit processor |\n| 2025 | Kookaburra (3-chip) | ~4,158 (3\u00d71,386) | ~10s | First QEC-enabled module |\n| 2026 | Kookaburra multi-chip | ~4,158+ | ~10s | Multi-chip quantum error correction |\n| 2027 | Cockatoo | Multi-module | ~50+ | Entanglement between QEC modules |\n| 2029 | Starling | ~6,300\u201313,000 | **~200** | First large-scale fault-tolerant system |\n| 2033 | Blue Jay | ~63,000\u2013130,000 | **~2,000** | \"Quantum-centric supercomputer\"; 1 billion gates |\n\nIBM's 2033 **Blue Jay** system, targeting 2,000 logical qubits, is directly relevant to Bitcoin security. As [Murmuration II (November 2025)](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-and-the-quantum-problem-part-47f) notes: \"IBM itself predicts that their Blue Jay system expected in 2033 will run circuits of 1 billion gates and 2,000 logical qubits \u2014 approaching but not yet exceeding the canonical 2,330 threshold for breaking ECC256.\"\n\nHowever, 2,000 logical qubits falls just below the canonical 2,330 threshold from Roetteler et al. Whether Blue Jay can break ECDSA-256 depends on final algorithmic optimization and the exact qubit count achievable.\n\nThe [PostQuantum.com IBM analysis](https://postquantum.com/quantum-computing-companies/ibm/) notes: \"IBM's 2029 goal of ~200 logical qubits falls short of that threshold... the 2033 Blue Jay vision of ~2,000 logical qubits would put IBM much closer to the CRQC realm.\"\n\n---\n\n## 3. Google Quantum AI\n\n### Current Hardware: Willow (December 2024)\n\nGoogle's **Willow** chip, announced in [Nature (December 2024)](https://phys.org/news/2024-12-google-quantum-chip-error.html) and described on [Google's blog](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/), represents the most significant quantum error correction milestone to date:\n\n- **105 physical qubits** (72-qubit and 105-qubit variants tested)\n- **T1 coherence time**: approaching 100 \u03bcs (~5\u00d7 improvement over predecessor Sycamore)\n- **Two-qubit gate fidelity**: Best-in-class; error rate halved vs. previous generation\n- **Historical benchmark**: Completed a random circuit sampling task in <5 minutes that would take the Frontier supercomputer (1.68 exaflops) approximately **10^25 years** \u2014 a number vastly exceeding the age of the universe\n\n### The \"Below Threshold\" Breakthrough\n\nWillow's landmark achievement was demonstrating **exponential quantum error correction below the fault-tolerance threshold** \u2014 a goal pursued for nearly 30 years. As [Physics (APS, December 2024)](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/176) explains:\n\n> \"Researchers at Google Quantum AI have demonstrated 'below-threshold' error correction \u2014 one that actually performs better as the number of quantum bits increases. Using ever-larger arrays of physical qubits, scaling from 3\u00d73 to 5\u00d75 to 7\u00d77, the error rate was cut in half each time.\"\n\nThis is the crucial theoretical prerequisite for scaling to a fault-tolerant CRQC: as the qubit array grows, errors decrease rather than accumulate. Google's [Nature paper](https://phys.org/news/2024-12-google-quantum-chip-error.html) notes that a 10\u207b\u2076 logical error rate may be achievable with 1,457 physical qubits (distance-27 surface code).\n\n### What Willow Does NOT Mean for Bitcoin\n\nDespite the extraordinary benchmark, [CoinShares (February 2026)](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/) contextualizes: \"Breaking secp256k1 in one hour requires 3 million times better than current quantum computers [Willow's 105 qubits].\" Willow is a proof-of-concept for the error correction architecture; it is roughly 4 to 5 orders of magnitude short of a CRQC for Bitcoin.\n\nThe [Next Platform's analysis (December 2024)](https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/12/09/google-claims-quantum-error-correction-milestone-with-willow-chip/) quotes Google's quantum hardware director: \"To be clear, there's really no point in doing quantum error correction if you are not below the threshold. This is really a critical key ingredient towards the future of making this technology real.\"\n\n### Google's Roadmap\n\nGoogle has not published a detailed public roadmap to the same degree as IBM, but the trajectory from Sycamore (53 qubits, 2019) through Willow (105 qubits, 2024) suggests continuing scaling of superconducting architectures toward hundreds, then thousands of logical qubits through the late 2020s and 2030s.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Quantinuum (Trapped Ion)\n\nQuantinuum operates the industry-leading trapped-ion quantum computers with the highest two-qubit gate fidelities:\n\n- **H2 processor (2024)**: 56 physical qubits, **99.8% two-qubit fidelity** \u2014 the basis for Microsoft/Quantinuum collaboration\n- **Microsoft/Quantinuum joint work (September 2024)**: Created **12 logical qubits** from 56 physical qubits with circuit error rate 22\u00d7 better than physical qubits. Per [Microsoft Azure Quantum Blog (September 2024)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2024/09/10/microsoft-and-quantinuum-create-12-logical-qubits-and-demonstrate-a-hybrid-end-to-end-chemistry-simulation/), \"this is the first demonstration of computation and error correction being beneficially combined.\"\n- **Helios processor (2025)**: 98 physical qubits, 48 logical qubits, per [Tom's Hardware (February 2026)](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/the-future-of-quantum-computing-the-tech-companies-and-roadmaps-that-map-out-a-coherent-quantum-future)\n- **June 2025 milestone**: Quantinuum demonstrated the [first universal, fully fault-tolerant quantum gate set](https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/06/27/quantinuum-crosses-key-quantum-error-correction-threshold-marks-turn-from-nisq-to-utility-scale/) with repeatable error correction \u2014 achieving magic state fidelity of 5.1\u00d710\u207b\u2074, a record. Internal simulations project error rates as low as 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 with future hardware.\n\nQuantinuum's roadmap (per [Microsoft Azure Quantum Blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2024/09/10/microsoft-and-quantinuum-create-12-logical-qubits-and-demonstrate-a-hybrid-end-to-end-chemistry-simulation/)) targets \"100 reliable logical qubits\" in a near-term hybrid supercomputer \u2014 enough for scientific advantage. The path to the thousands of logical qubits required for Bitcoin is still significant.\n\n---\n\n## 5. IonQ (Trapped Ion)\n\nIonQ announced a landmark achievement in **October 2025**: [>99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity](https://postquantum.com/quantum-research/ionq-record-2025/) \u2014 surpassing the previous world record of 99.97% (2024). Technical details from [IonQ's own resources (November 2025)](https://www.ionq.com/resources/demystifying-logical-qubits-and-fault-tolerance):\n\n- **Gate fidelity**: >99.99% two-qubit (0.000084 average error per gate across 432-gate sequences)\n- **Thermal robustness**: Fidelity maintained above 99.995% even with deliberately heated ions (n\u0304 \u2248 9.4)\n- **Technology**: Proprietary Electronic Qubit Control (EQC) \u2014 microchip-integrated control replacing laser systems\n- **256-qubit prototype**: Planned for 2026\n\n[IonQ's roadmap](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/the-future-of-quantum-computing-the-tech-companies-and-roadmaps-that-map-out-a-coherent-quantum-future) (per Tom's Hardware, February 2026):\n\n| Year | Physical Qubits | Logical Qubits |\n|------|----------------|----------------|\n| 2026 | ~256 (prototype) | \u2014 |\n| 2028 | 20,000 | 1,600 |\n| 2029 | 200,000 | 8,000 |\n| 2030 | 2,000,000 | 80,000 |\n\nIf realized, IonQ's 2029 target of **8,000 logical qubits** would far exceed the ~2,330 needed for ECDSA-256 \u2014 but these are ambitious projections requiring multiple breakthroughs in scaling and error correction.\n\nThe [PostQuantum.com IonQ analysis (October 2025)](https://postquantum.com/quantum-research/ionq-record-2025/) notes: \"On error rate, IonQ now exceeds what Gidney assumed [for CRQC calculations]. On speed and scale, key disclosures are pending.\"\n\n---\n\n## 6. Other Notable Hardware\n\n### Amazon Braket / Ocelot\nAmazon's **Ocelot** chip (2025) demonstrated progress in **cat qubit** architecture, a fundamentally different error correction approach that may offer advantages in error bias. Mentioned by Project Eleven as a significant development.\n\n### Microsoft / Majorana 1\nMicrosoft's **Majorana 1** chip (2025) is based on **topological qubits** \u2014 a theoretically superior approach to error correction that has been pursued for over a decade. Microsoft claims this approach could reach a CRQC with far fewer physical qubits, though the field remains nascent and reproducibility challenges have been noted.\n\n### PsiQuantum\nPsiQuantum raised **$750 million in Q1 2025**, per [Project Eleven's analysis](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/project-eleven-to-award-1-btc-to-tackle-bitcoins-quantum-vulnerability), citing photonic chip design advancements and Shor's algorithm optimization. PsiQuantum's photonic approach operates at room temperature but requires millions of qubits for fault tolerance \u2014 targeting the 2030s.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Physical vs. Logical Qubits: The Overhead Burden\n\nThe distinction between physical and logical qubits is fundamental to understanding realistic CRQC timelines.\n\n**Physical qubits** are the actual quantum hardware components \u2014 noisy, error-prone, with typical gate fidelities of 99.0%\u201399.99% and coherence times of microseconds to milliseconds.\n\n**Logical qubits** are error-corrected qubits formed by encoding redundancy across many physical qubits. A logical qubit is stable enough to sustain a long computation.\n\n**The overhead ratio:**\n\n| Physical Gate Fidelity | Physical Qubits per Logical Qubit (Surface Code) | Notes |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| 99.0% | ~1,000\u201310,000 | Current NISQ era |\n| 99.9% | ~100\u20131,000 | Current best systems (IBM Heron, Quantinuum H2) |\n| 99.99% | ~12\u201335 | IBM's target (LDPC codes); IonQ 2025 demonstrated |\n| 99.999% | ~5\u201312 | Future; enables compact CRQCs |\n\nIBM's LDPC target of **12 physical qubits per logical qubit** requires ~99.99% gate fidelity, achievable per their 2029 Starling timeline, per [PostQuantum.com IBM analysis](https://postquantum.com/quantum-computing-companies/ibm/).\n\nAt this ratio, a machine capable of breaking ECDSA-256 (2,330 logical qubits) would require approximately **28,000\u201377,000 physical qubits** \u2014 achievable with IBM's projected Kookaburra/Cockatoo architecture well before 2030 in theory, but contingent on achieving the 99.99% gate fidelity target.\n\n---\n\n## 8. When Could a CRQC Capable of Breaking Bitcoin Exist?\n\nMultiple authoritative sources have offered timeline estimates. They span roughly a decade in range:\n\n### Short-Term Estimates (2027\u20132030)\n\n- **Vitalik Buterin (2025)**: Warned that elliptic curve cryptography \"could end up being compromised by quantum computing before 2028,\" per [TradingView/CryptoRank](https://www.tradingview.com/news/u_today:657dd1b3f094b:0-718-billion-bitcoin-quantum-threat-to-be-addressed-by-new-startup/).\n- **Dallaire-Demers et al. (2025)**: The ECDLP challenge ladder paper projects \"the first intersections\" of rising quantum capabilities and falling resource requirements \"between 2027 and 2033,\" per [Murmuration II](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-and-the-quantum-problem-part-47f).\n- **IonQ roadmap**: If realized, 8,000 logical qubits by 2029 would exceed what's needed for ECDSA-256.\n\n### Mid-Term Estimates (2030\u20132035)\n\n- **NIST / PQShield (December 2024)**: NIST's IR 8547 recommends full system transition to PQC by **2035**, \"a deadline based on the expectation of a viable quantum technique for breaking current encryption methods,\" per [PQShield](https://pqshield.com/nist-recommends-timelines-for-transitioning-cryptographic-algorithms/).\n- **Juniper Research (2024)**: \"We shouldn't expect the arrival of commercial quantum computers before **2035**,\" per [Juniper Research](https://www.juniperresearch.com/resources/blog/nist-unveils-quantum-computing-proof-standards-when-will-the-threat-arrive/).\n- **Citi Institute (2026)**: Estimates a 19\u201334% probability of Q-Day by **2034**, rising to 60\u201382% by **2044**, per [Citi Quantum Threat report](https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/Citi_Institute_Quantum_Threat.pdf).\n- **Kalshi prediction markets**: Imply roughly **40% probability of a useful quantum computer by 2030**, per [Citi](https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/Citi_Institute_Quantum_Threat.pdf).\n\n### Long-Term Estimates (2035\u20132050)\n\n- **CoinShares (February 2026)**: \"Estimates suggest cryptographically relevant quantum computers may not emerge until the 2030s or later, with some analyses projecting **10\u201320 years**,\" per [CoinShares](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/).\n- **Webber et al. (2022)**: Webber stated in 2022 that \"this will not happen within the next decade,\" implying no earlier than ~2032.\n- **Bitcoin researcher Ethan Heilman (2026)**: Estimated Bitcoin needs \"at least **seven years** to fortify its defenses,\" implying urgency even if CRQC is ~7\u201315 years away, per [CryptoRank](https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/7e26b-bitcoin-quantum-threat-timeline-research).\n\n### The Gidney 2025 Update: A Significant Downward Revision\n\nA May 2025 paper by Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney dramatically revised the resource estimate for breaking RSA-2048:\n\n> \"Breaking RSA-2048 in under a week using fewer than **one million physical qubits** \u2014 a 20\u00d7 reduction from the 2019 estimate of 20 million qubits.\" \u2014 [The Quantum Insider (May 2025)](https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/05/24/google-researcher-lowers-quantum-bar-to-crack-rsa-encryption/)\n\nThis result (for RSA-2048, which is roughly comparable in difficulty to ECC-256) employs algorithmic improvements including approximate residue arithmetic, yoked surface codes, and magic state cultivation. The [Quantum Computing Report](https://quantumcomputingreport.com/significant-theoretical-advancement-in-factoring-2048-bit-rsa-integers/) confirmed this as \"a significant theoretical advancement.\"\n\nWhile the hardware doesn't exist yet, the trend of downward resource revisions \u2014 from 20 million (2019) to <1 million (2025) \u2014 suggests CRQC timelines may be shorter than estimates from just a few years ago assumed.\n\n---\n\n## 9.

Caveats and Uncertainties\n\n1. **Error correction scaling may be harder than expected.** \"Below threshold\" (Willow) is a necessary but not sufficient condition. Scaling from 105 qubits to millions while maintaining below-threshold performance has never been demonstrated.\n\n2. **Roadmaps are aspirational.** IBM has historically met its roadmap targets; IonQ's million-qubit vision for 2030 is far more speculative.\n\n3. **Classified capabilities.** As [Reddit/QuantumComputing users note](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/1mlmgrw/), \"we may not have full access to actual advancements in quantum hardware.\" Nation-state programs (US, China, others) may be ahead of public disclosures.\n\n4. **Algorithmic improvements continue.** The 20\u00d7 improvement in Gidney's 2025 vs. 2019 estimates shows that resource requirements can fall rapidly. Future algorithmic breakthroughs could compress timelines further.\n\n5. **\"Harvest now, decrypt later\" is already underway.** Adversaries are presumably cataloging on-chain P2PK public keys today. The \"harvest\" phase requires no quantum hardware; only the \"decrypt later\" phase does.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n1. Webber, M. et al.

  "01-threat-model/shor-vs-ecdsa": "# Shor's Algorithm vs. Bitcoin's ECDSA\n\n\n> **Last updated:** February 28, 2026 | **Confidence shelf-life:** 2 years (theoretical result, stable)\n\n\n*Part of the Bitcoin Quantum Threat Corpus \u2014 Phase 1a: Threat Model*\n\n**See also:**\n- [Grover's Algorithm vs SHA-256](./grover-vs-sha256.md)\n- [Vulnerable vs Safe UTXOs](./vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md)\n- [Quantum Hardware Status](./quantum-hardware-status.md)\n- [Signature Scheme Comparison](../04-signature-schemes/comparison-matrix.md)\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Mathematical Foundation: ECDLP and secp256k1\n\nBitcoin's transaction authorization rests entirely on the **Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)** over the **secp256k1** curve. The security of this system depends on the computational intractability of the **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**.\n\nThe secp256k1 curve is defined by the short Weierstrass equation:\n\n```\ny\u00b2 = x\u00b3 + 7  (over a 256-bit prime field p)\n```\n\nA private key `d` is a 256-bit integer. The corresponding public key `Q` is computed by scalar multiplication of the generator point `G`:\n\n```\nQ = d \u00b7 G\n```\n\nThe ECDLP asks: given `Q`, `G`, and `p`, find `d`. On a classical computer, the best known algorithms (Pollard's rho, Pohlig-Hellman) require approximately O(2^128) operations \u2014 effectively infeasible for 256-bit curves. As of 2025, the largest solved secp256k1-type discrete log puzzle sits at 129 bits via Pollard's rho; the full 256-bit problem remains entirely out of classical reach, as documented by the [ECDLP challenge ladder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14011) introduced by Dallaire-Demers et al. (2025).\n\n---\n\n## 2. How Shor's Algorithm Solves the ECDLP\n\nPeter Shor's 1994 algorithm reduces both integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems to **quantum period-finding** via the Quantum Fourier Transform. The key insight is that the discrete log `d` can be recovered by finding the period of a function defined on the group of elliptic curve points.\n\nFor the ECDLP specifically, Shor's algorithm works as follows, as explained in detail by [Project Eleven's technical blog](https://blog.projecteleven.com/posts/shors-algorithm-for-discrete-logs) (2025):\n\n1. **Group encoding**: Represent the elliptic curve group operation as a quantum circuit. Each element is an (x, y) coordinate pair on the secp256k1 curve.\n2. **Superposition**: Prepare a quantum register in a uniform superposition over all possible exponents.\n3. **Quantum oracle**: Compute `d \u00b7 G` and `1 \u00b7 G` simultaneously across all superposition states using reversible quantum circuits for elliptic curve point addition.\n4. **QFT and period finding**: Apply the Quantum Fourier Transform to extract the hidden period, which encodes the discrete logarithm `d`.\n5. **Classical post-processing**: Use lattice methods or continued fraction expansion to extract `d` from the measured period.\n\nThe critical asymmetry: classical algorithms require O(2^128) operations for secp256k1-256; Shor's algorithm requires only O(n\u00b3) polynomial steps for an n-bit key. For 256-bit ECDSA, this represents a reduction from ~3.4\u00d710\u00b3\u2078 operations to roughly a few hundred million \u2014 a factor of ~10\u00b2\u2079 speedup in algorithmic complexity, as noted in [Bitcoin Magazine's foundational analysis](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-is-not-quantum-safe-and-how-we-can-fix-1375242150).\n\nThe algorithm's applicability to secp256k1 is confirmed in a formal challenge ladder published by [Dallaire-Demers et al. (August 2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14011), which explicitly uses `y\u00b2 = x\u00b3 + 7 (mod p)` \u2014 Bitcoin's exact curve \u2014 to build a graded series of ECDLP instances from 6 bits to 256 bits, providing a \"transparent, fine-grained ruler\" to benchmark quantum progress toward breaking Bitcoin's cryptography.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Attack Scenario: Public Key to Private Key\n\nThe attack chain against a Bitcoin private key proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **Obtain the public key**: The attacker reads the 256-bit (or 512-bit uncompressed) ECDSA public key `Q` from the blockchain or mempool.\n2. **Run Shor's ECDLP circuit**: Input `Q` and the known generator point `G` of secp256k1. Execute the quantum period-finding subroutine on a fault-tolerant quantum computer.\n3. **Extract the private key `d`**: Classical post-processing recovers `d` from the quantum measurement result.\n4. **Sign a fraudulent transaction**: Using `d`, the attacker constructs a valid ECDSA signature spending the victim's UTXOs to an attacker-controlled address.\n5. **Broadcast**: The signed transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network. Nodes accept it as valid \u2014 they have no way to distinguish it from a genuine owner-initiated spend.\n\nThis attack is described in detail by [Chaincode Labs' 2025 report *Bitcoin and Quantum Computing: Current Status and Future Directions*](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf): \"an attacker can use a quantum-derived private key to steal Bitcoin by creating and broadcasting a valid transaction that spends the victim's UTXOs to an address they control.\"\n\n---\n\n## 4. Qubit Requirements: Logical and Physical\n\n### 4.1 Logical Qubit Estimates\n\nThe canonical estimate for logical qubits required to execute Shor's ECDLP on secp256k1 comes from **Roetteler, Naehrig, Svore, and Lauter (Microsoft Research, 2017)**:\n\n> Breaking ECC-256 requires approximately **2,330 logical qubits** using optimized quantum circuits for point addition. The full Shor algorithm requires ~1.26 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u00b9 Toffoli gates.\n\nThis figure is cited across the scientific literature, including in the [Chaincode Labs report](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) and [peer-reviewed analysis in Nature Scientific Reports](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10873342/) (2024). The Roetteler formula yields a qubit count of approximately `9n + 2\u2308log\u2082(n)\u2309 + 10` for an n-bit prime field, giving 2,330 for n=256.\n\nThe [Murmuration II analysis (November 2025)](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-and-the-quantum-problem-part-47f) confirms: \"The number of logical qubits needed to break ECC256 with Shor is fairly well established: 2330 based on Roetteler et al. (2017).\" Subsequent algorithmic research has proposed reductions; a recent 2025 preprint references estimates in the **100,000\u20132,871 logical qubit** range depending on depth-vs-space trade-offs, with the most aggressive optimization cited at [2,871 logical qubits](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/1mlmgrw/) for a particular QLDPC formulation.\n\nFor comparison, IBM's 2033 \"Blue Jay\" system targets **2,000 logical qubits** \u2014 just below the canonical 2,330 threshold \u2014 underscoring the relevance of the timeline.\n\n### 4.2 Physical Qubit Requirements (With Error Correction Overhead)\n\nLogical qubits must be encoded in many error-prone physical qubits. The seminal physical qubit estimate is from **Webber, Bova, Gao, Webber, and van Dam (University of Sussex / Universal Quantum, 2022)**, published in [*AVS Quantum Science*](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/physics/iqt/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Webber-2022.pdf) and [summarized by Schneier on Security](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/02/breaking-245-bit-elliptic-curve-encryption-with-a-quantum-computer.html):\n\n| Time Budget to Break ECDSA-256 | Physical Qubits Required |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 10 minutes (mempool window)    | **1.9 billion** (1.9 \u00d7 10\u2079) |\n| 1 hour                         | **317 million** (3.17 \u00d7 10\u2078) |\n| 1 day                          | **13 million** (1.3 \u00d7 10\u2077) |\n\nThese estimates assume: surface code error correction, code cycle time of 1 \u03bcs, reaction time of 10 \u03bcs, and physical gate error rate of 10\u207b\u00b3. As noted by [Forklog](https://forklog.com/en/researchers-estimate-quantum-computer-power-needed-to-crack-bitcoin/), state-of-the-art quantum hardware in 2022 had only 50\u2013100 physical qubits \u2014 7 to 9 orders of magnitude short of these requirements.\n\nThe [CoinShares analysis (February 2026)](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/) frames this starkly: \"Breaking secp256k1 within one day requires ~13 million physical qubits \u2014 about 100,000 times more than the largest current quantum computer.\"\n\n### 4.3 Error Correction Overhead\n\nThe ratio of physical to logical qubits depends heavily on the error correction code and physical gate fidelity:\n\n- **Surface code** (IBM, Google approach): Approximately 1,000\u201310,000 physical qubits per logical qubit at current ~99.9% gate fidelity. IBM's optimistic LDPC target is a **12:1 ratio**, achievable at ~99.99% physical gate fidelity, per [IBM's quantum roadmap analysis](https://postquantum.com/quantum-computing-companies/ibm/).\n- **LDPC codes**: With IBM's 2029 target of 99.99% fidelity, approximately 31\u201335 physical qubits per logical qubit (gross code variant).\n- At current error rates (~99.9% fidelity), practical overhead is **100\u20131,000\u00d7 per logical qubit**.\n\nFor 2,330 logical qubits at a 1,000:1 overhead ratio: ~2.3 million physical qubits needed (minimum, under optimistic assumptions). At more realistic 10,000:1 overheads: ~23 million physical qubits. This explains the Webber estimates above.\n\n---\n\n## 5. The \"Exposed Public Key\" Problem\n\nShor's algorithm requires the public key as input. Bitcoin's various address types differ critically in when \u2014 and whether \u2014 the public key is exposed. (See also: [Vulnerable vs Safe UTXOs](./vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md).)\n\n**Permanently exposed (long-range attack targets):**\n- **P2PK addresses**: The full public key is embedded directly in the `scriptPubKey` (locking script). These include all of Satoshi's early mining rewards. Approximately **1.72 million BTC** sits in P2PK UTXOs, [per Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf).\n- **P2TR (Taproot) addresses**: A tweaked public key is embedded in the output script, making the public key visible as soon as funds are received. Taproot addresses hold approximately **146,715\u2013196,292 BTC** in vulnerable exposure, per [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf), [Checkonchain (December 2025)](https://newsletter.checkonchain.com/p/one-day-satoshis-coins-will-move), and [BitMEX Research / Dune Analytics (February 2026)](https://dune.com/murchandamus/bitcoins-utxo-set).\n- **Reused P2PKH/P2WPKH addresses**: Any address that has previously been spent from has its public key permanently recorded on the blockchain. This affects an estimated **4.49 million BTC** due to address reuse, per the [Human Rights Foundation / Chaincode 2025 analysis](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf).\n\n**Temporarily exposed (short-range attack):**\n- **Any address type during an active spend**: When a user broadcasts a transaction, the public key is revealed in the mempool before confirmation. This creates a race-condition window.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Time Constraints: The Mempool Race\n\nBitcoin blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes, though confirmation times vary. The mempool attack window is the period between a transaction's broadcast and its inclusion in a block.\n\nThe [CoinShares report (February 2026)](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/) frames the two attack regimes:\n\n> \"Long-term exposures such as P2PK addresses would then be vulnerable to computations that could be on the order of years. Short-term exposures, such as public keys visible in the mempool during transactions, would demand computations in less than 10 minutes.\"\n\nWebber et al. (2022) quantified the mempool attack cost at **1.9 billion physical qubits** for a 10-minute window \u2014 roughly **18 million times** more qubits than the current largest machine (Google Willow, 105 qubits). Breaking in one hour requires 317 million physical qubits; 13 million for a 24-hour window.\n\nFor the mempool attack to succeed, the attacker must:\n1. Detect the transaction in the mempool\n2. Extract the public key\n3. Run Shor's ECDLP circuit and obtain the private key\n4. Construct a competing transaction with higher fees\n5. Broadcast the competing transaction\n\nAll of this must complete before the original transaction is mined \u2014 typically 10 minutes, but potentially less if the attacker can influence mempool dynamics. The [Chaincode Labs report](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) classifies this as a **\"short-range attack\"**, distinct from the more achievable **\"long-range attack\"** on static keys.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Harvest Now, Decrypt Later vs. Real-Time Attacks\n\nThese two attack models require fundamentally different quantum capabilities:\n\n### 7.1 Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (Long-Range Attack)\n\nApplies to: P2PK UTXOs, Taproot key-path outputs, reused P2PKH addresses.\n\nIn this model, the public key is already permanently recorded on the blockchain. An attacker with a sufficiently capable quantum computer can, at any future time, read the public key from historical blockchain data and run Shor's algorithm with **no time pressure**. The computation can take days, weeks, or even months \u2014 as long as it completes before the owner moves the funds.\n\nThis is the more tractable near-term threat. The 13-million-physical-qubit estimate (1-day window, Webber et al.) likely overstates the requirement for a truly patient attacker who can dedicate a quantum computer to a single key for an extended period. [CoinShares](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/) notes that Satoshi's coins specifically \"would then be vulnerable to computations that could be on the order of years\" \u2014 meaning even a slower, less powerful CRQC could eventually break them given sufficient time.\n\nThe [Chaincode Labs report](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) notes that Bitcoin forks (Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold) have inadvertently exposed public keys of Bitcoin UTXOs: \"when spending these outputs on fork chains, users revealed the public keys associated with their Bitcoin UTXOs, even if they haven't yet spent those UTXOs on the Bitcoin network.\"\n\nThe \"harvest now\" concept is also relevant: adversaries can record all on-chain P2PK public keys today and wait for quantum hardware to mature before executing the attack. This is already theoretically occurring.\n\n### 7.2 Real-Time Mempool Attack (Short-Range Attack)\n\nApplies to: Any transaction currently in the mempool, regardless of address type.\n\nThis model requires a quantum computer capable of running Shor's ECDLP in under 10 minutes \u2014 requiring approximately 1.9 billion physical qubits per Webber et al. (2022). Even under optimistic scenarios, this capability is considered **decades away**. The [CoinShares report (2026)](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/) classifies this as \"infeasible except in the very long term (decades).\"\n\n[BIP-360](https://bip360.org/bip360.html), the first official quantum-resistant Bitcoin proposal (merged into Bitcoin's core development repository in early 2026), explicitly acknowledges it does not protect against mempool attacks \u2014 it addresses only the long-range threat to cold storage.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Summary Table\n\n| Attack Type | Target | Time Budget | Physical Qubits Required | Feasibility Timeline |\n|-------------|--------|-------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| Long-range (static P2PK) | Satoshi/legacy coins | Days\u2013years | < 13 million | Possibly 2030s\u20132040s |\n| Long-range (reused address) | Exchange/user wallets | Days\u2013weeks | ~13 million | Possibly 2030s\u20132040s |\n| Short-range (mempool) | Any live transaction | < 10 minutes | ~1.9 billion | Likely 2050s+ |\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n1.

The Core Vulnerability Classification\n\nBitcoin's UTXO set contains outputs locked to various script types. The quantum threat level of a UTXO depends on a single question: **is the ECDSA public key currently visible on the blockchain?**\n\nIf yes \u2192 Shor's algorithm can recover the private key with no time pressure (long-range attack).  \nIf no \u2192 The attacker must wait until the owner broadcasts a spending transaction, then race to derive the private key before the transaction confirms (~10 minutes), requiring vastly more quantum hardware.\n\nThe [Chaincode Labs 2025 report](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) formalizes this as two attack vectors:\n\n> \"Long-range attacks target funds associated with public keys already exposed on [the blockchain]. Short-range attacks require deriving the private key within a narrow window of time [during transaction broadcast].\"\n\n---\n\n## 2. Address Types: Technical Analysis\n\n### 2.1 P2PK (Pay-to-Public-Key) \u2014 **HIGHEST VULNERABILITY**\n\n**Script structure:** `<pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG`\n\nIn P2PK, the full 33-byte (compressed) or 65-byte (uncompressed) ECDSA public key is embedded directly in the `scriptPubKey`. There is no hash \u2014 the public key is permanently and immediately visible to anyone with access to the blockchain, which means the entire world.\n\n**Quantum exposure:** Immediate from the moment the UTXO is created. The public key never needs to be \"revealed\" through a spend \u2014 it is always exposed. This makes P2PK the most vulnerable format: an attacker with a CRQC can target these UTXOs with unlimited time to run Shor's algorithm.\n\n**Historical context:** P2PK was Bitcoin's original output type, used throughout 2009\u20132012. Most early block rewards \u2014 including those attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 used P2PK. It was superseded by P2PKH in 2010\u20132011 as wallets began implementing the public-key-hash protection.\n\n**Statistics (as of mid-2025, per [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf)):**\n- ~0.025% of UTXOs by count\n- **~1,720,747 BTC locked** (~8.68% of Bitcoin's total supply by value)\n- Only ~67 new P2PK UTXOs created in the past 2.5 years \u2014 effectively deprecated\n- 38,157 P2PK addresses total ([Checkonchain, December 2025](https://newsletter.checkonchain.com/p/one-day-satoshis-coins-will-move))\n\nThe [Checkonchain analysis (December 2025)](https://newsletter.checkonchain.com/p/one-day-satoshis-coins-will-move) notes: \"The 1.720M BTC held in Satoshi Era P2PK addresses are the most at risk, since they are very likely lost, and are equivalent to a full year of bull market distribution pressure by 3-year+ coins.\"\n\n### 2.2 Satoshi's Coins: The Quantum Honeypot\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto's estimated **~1.0\u20131.1 million BTC** is held predominantly in P2PK addresses created in 2009\u20132010, making it the single largest quantum-vulnerable position on any blockchain. This estimate originates from the \"Patoshi pattern\" analysis by blockchain researcher **Sergio Demian Lerner (2013, updated through 2019)**, who identified a distinct ExtraNonce mining signature in approximately 22,000 early blocks attributable to a single dominant miner, widely believed to be Satoshi. [Arkham Intelligence (February 2026)](https://info.arkm.com/research/who-owns-the-most-bitcoin-top-btc-holders-2026) corroborates this with a figure of 1.096 million BTC. A more conservative estimate from [BitMEX Research (2018)](https://blog.bitmex.com/satoshis-1-million-bitcoin/) places the figure at 600,000\u2013700,000 BTC, arguing some Patoshi-attributed blocks may belong to other early miners. The range of credible estimates is therefore **~600K\u20131.1M BTC**, with the upper end more widely cited. As [CoinTelegraph's analysis (November 2025)](https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:16fb594d6094b:0-what-happens-to-satoshi-s-1m-bitcoin-if-quantum-computers-go-live/) explains:\n\n> \"In this legacy format, there is no hash. The public key itself \u2014 the lock in our analogy \u2014 is visibly and permanently recorded on the blockchain for everyone to see.\"\n\nThe [Human Rights Foundation / Chaincode 2025 report](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) found **6.51 million BTC total** in vulnerable addresses, with **1.72 million BTC in very early address types** (including Satoshi's) considered dormant or potentially lost and thus unlikely to migrate to quantum-safe formats.\n\nThe significance of Satoshi's coins specifically extends beyond financial value. As [CoinTelegraph notes](https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:16fb594d6094b:0-what-happens-to-satoshi-s-1m-bitcoin-if-quantum-computers-go-live/): \"If a hostile actor were the first to reach Q-Day, the simple act of moving Satoshi's coins would serve as proof of a successful attack. It would instantly show that Bitcoin's fundamental security had been broken, triggering market-wide panic, a bank run on exchanges and an existential crisis for the entire crypto ecosystem.\"\n\n### 2.3 P2MS (Pay-to-MultiSig, \"Raw MultiSig\") \u2014 **HIGH VULNERABILITY**\n\n**Script structure:** `OP_m <pubkey1> <pubkey2> ... <pubkeyN> OP_n OP_CHECKMULTISIG`\n\nLike P2PK, raw P2MS embeds public keys directly in the locking script. All N public keys are visible on-chain from the moment the UTXO is created.\n\n**Statistics (per [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf)):**\n- ~1.037% of UTXOs\n- Only ~57 BTC total (negligible value)\n- Largely a historical artifact; superseded by P2SH-wrapped multisig\n\n### 2.4 P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash) \u2014 **CONDITIONALLY SAFE**\n\n**Script structure (locking):** `OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`  \n**Script structure (unlocking):** `<signature> <pubkey>`\n\nP2PKH is the original \"1...\" Bitcoin address format. The locking script stores only the 20-byte RIPEMD-160 hash of the public key, not the public key itself. The actual public key is revealed only in the **spending transaction's unlocking script (`scriptSig`)**.\n\n**Quantum exposure:**\n- **Unspent P2PKH address (never used to send):** The public key is hidden behind RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(pubkey)). The best quantum attack would require Grover's algorithm to reverse RIPEMD-160, giving 80-bit security. **Currently safe.**\n- **Spent P2PKH address / reused address:** Once the address has been spent from, the public key is permanently recorded in the spending transaction on the blockchain. Any remaining balance at that address is then subject to long-range attack. **Vulnerable if reused.**\n\nThe [Chaincode Labs report](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) specifies: \"Address re-use is recognized to be bad for privacy; it remains a common practice. It is also particularly dangerous in a post-quantum environment as it transforms script types that would normally only be vulnerable to short-range attacks into ones that are vulnerable to long-range attacks.\"\n\n**Statistics on reused P2PKH:** According to [ChainCode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf), approximately **4.49 million BTC** in reused addresses is at risk \u2014 representing 69% of the total 6.51 million BTC in vulnerable positions, primarily driven by exchange and institutional cold wallet address reuse, per the [AInvest / ChainCode analysis (July 2025)](https://www.ainvest.com/news/bitcoin-news-today-32-7-bitcoin-supply-quantum-risk-address-reuse-exposes-6-36-million-btc-potential-attacks-2507/).\n\n### 2.5 P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash) \u2014 **CONDITIONALLY SAFE**\n\n**Script structure (locking):** `OP_HASH160 <scriptHash> OP_EQUAL`  \n**Address prefix:** \"3...\"\n\nP2SH hides the entire redeem script (which contains public keys) behind a 20-byte hash. The redeem script and all public keys are revealed only at spend time.\n\n**Quantum exposure:**\n- **Unspent:** The redeem script and public keys are hidden. Safe while unspent (subject to Grover's at 80-bit RIPEMD-160 security \u2014 same as unspent P2PKH).\n- **Spent / reused:** If the P2SH address has been spent from, the redeem script and all embedded public keys are publicly visible, enabling long-range attack on remaining funds.\n- **Most common P2SH usage** is P2SH-P2WPKH (SegWit wrapped for legacy compatibility) and P2SH-P2WSH multisig \u2014 both expose public keys at spend time.\n\n**Assessment:** Same vulnerability profile as P2PKH \u2014 safe while unspent, vulnerable if reused.\n\n### 2.6 P2WPKH (Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash) \u2014 **CONDITIONALLY SAFE**\n\n**Address format:** \"bc1q...\" (Bech32)\n\nThe native SegWit equivalent of P2PKH. Public key hash is stored in the witness program. The public key is revealed in the witness data at spend time.\n\n**Quantum exposure:** Identical to P2PKH \u2014 safe while unspent (key hidden), vulnerable if address is reused after spending.\n\n### 2.7 P2WSH (Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash) \u2014 **CONDITIONALLY SAFE**\n\nThe native SegWit equivalent of P2SH (used primarily for multisig). The witness script and all embedded public keys are revealed at spend time.\n\n**Quantum exposure:** Same as P2SH \u2014 safe while unspent, vulnerable if reused.\n\n### 2.8 P2TR (Pay-to-Taproot) \u2014 **IMMEDIATELY VULNERABLE**\n\n**Address format:** \"bc1p...\" (Bech32m)  \n**Introduced:** November 2021 (Bitcoin block 709,632)\n\nTaproot is Bitcoin's most recent upgrade. P2TR addresses embed a **tweaked public key** directly in the `scriptPubKey`:\n\n```\nOP_1 <tweaked_pubkey>\n```\n\nThis makes P2TR addresses **immediately vulnerable** upon receiving funds \u2014 the (tweaked) public key is visible from the moment the UTXO exists. This is structurally similar to P2PK in terms of quantum exposure, despite being a modern address format.\n\nThe [Chaincode Labs report](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) explains: \"Because the tweaked public key is exposed on the blockchain, a CRQC could potentially derive the corresponding private key, enabling unauthorized spending via the key-path without needing to satisfy any script conditions.\"\n\n**A potential mitigation:** Unlike P2PK, P2TR's vulnerability could be addressed \"through a soft fork that disables key-path spending if quantum threats materialize,\" per [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf). Users could still spend via the script-path, which may use hash-protected conditions.\n\n**Statistics:**\n- ~32.5% of UTXOs by count (P2TR adoption has grown rapidly)\n- **~146,715\u2013184,000 BTC locked** (~0.74\u20131% of supply)\n- These are likely active, technically sophisticated users who can migrate, per [Checkonchain (December 2025)](https://newsletter.checkonchain.com/p/one-day-satoshis-coins-will-move)\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Total BTC at Risk: Statistics and Estimates\n\nMultiple analyses have attempted to quantify the total vulnerable Bitcoin supply. Estimates vary based on methodology and what counts as \"vulnerable\":\n\n### 4.1 Conservative Estimate (P2PK and P2MS Only)\n\n- **~1.72 million BTC** in P2PK addresses (including Satoshi's ~1.1M BTC)\n- **~57 BTC** in P2MS\n- **~184k BTC** in P2TR\n- **Total immediately vulnerable: ~1.9 million BTC** (~$171 billion at late 2025 prices)\n- Source: [Checkonchain (December 2025)](https://newsletter.checkonchain.com/p/one-day-satoshis-coins-will-move)\n\n### 4.2 Moderate Estimate (Including Reused Addresses)\n\n- [ChainCode Labs (2025)](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf): **~6.26 million BTC** (~30% of supply, ~$650 billion)\n  - Includes P2PK/P2MS/P2TR plus all addresses with exposed public keys via reuse\n  - ~11.1 million individual addresses affected\n\n### 4.3 Broader Estimates\n\n- [AInvest / ChainCode Labs (July 2025)](https://www.ainvest.com/news/bitcoin-news-today-32-7-bitcoin-supply-quantum-risk-address-reuse-exposes-6-36-million-btc-potential-attacks-2507/): **6.36 million BTC (32.7% of supply)**\n  - 69% of this (~4.49M BTC) from address reuse by exchanges and early adopters\n- [Human Rights Foundation (October 2025)](https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:16fb594d6094b:0-what-happens-to-satoshi-s-1m-bitcoin-if-quantum-computers-go-live/): **6.51 million BTC** vulnerable\n  - 1.72M BTC likely dormant/lost; 4.49M BTC vulnerable but potentially migrateable\n- [Investing.com (February 2026)](https://www.investing.com/analysis/bitcoin-faces-the-quantum-countdown-200674443): \"Approximately 25% of all bitcoins \u2014 over 5 million BTC \u2014 are stored in 'vulnerable' addresses\"\n- [Project Eleven (2025)](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/project-eleven-to-award-1-btc-to-tackle-bitcoins-quantum-vulnerability): **>6.2 million BTC** (~$500 billion) \"currently held in wallets with exposed public keys\"\n- [Compare the Cloud (February 2026)](https://www.comparethecloud.net/news/research-455-billion-in-bitcoin-exposed-to-quantum-attack-risk-via-address-reuse): **$455 billion** exposed via address reuse alone (16% increase since 2020)\n\n### 4.4 \"Likely Lost\" Subset (Highest Risk)\n\nThe most dangerous category is coins that are both quantum-vulnerable **and** likely permanently lost \u2014 meaning owners cannot migrate them even given warning. [Checkonchain (December 2025)](https://newsletter.checkonchain.com/p/one-day-satoshis-coins-will-move) estimates:\n\n> \"Globally, I estimate there are between **2.08M ($187B) and 2.63M ($237B) vulnerable and lost BTC** \u2014 equivalent to 3x to 4x Strategy Treasuries.\"\n\nThis includes ~1.72M BTC in Satoshi-era P2PK (probably permanently lost), ~113k BTC in dormant unlabelled reused addresses, and a proportional share of the broader reuse set.\n\n---\n\n## 5. The Address Reuse Problem\n\nAddress reuse is described consistently across the literature as the single largest driver of quantum vulnerability in Bitcoin's modern UTXO set.\n\nWhen a user sends Bitcoin from a P2PKH or P2WPKH address, the public key is revealed in the spending transaction. If any funds were subsequently received by the same address (a common wallet behavior), those funds are now permanently exposed to long-range quantum attack \u2014 as vulnerable as if they were in a P2PK address.\n\n[Murmuration II (November 2025)](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-and-the-quantum-problem-part-47f) identifies the Binance cold wallet as an illustrative extreme case: \"You could instead go for the biggest prize: the Binance cold wallet `34xp4vRoCGJym3xR7yCVPFHoCNxv4Twseo` with an exposed public key and 248k BTC in it.\"\n\n**Why address reuse happened:** In Bitcoin's early years, many wallets (including early versions of Bitcoin Core) would return change to the same \"from\" address. Exchanges routinely reuse cold wallet addresses for operational simplicity. This was understood as a privacy weakness; only now is the quantum dimension being fully appreciated.\n\n**The fork exposure vector:** [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) identifies an underappreciated route: \"When Bitcoin was forked in 2017, the UTXO set was duplicated across chains... When spending these outputs on fork chains [Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold], users revealed the public keys associated with their Bitcoin UTXOs, even if they haven't yet spent those UTXOs on the Bitcoin network.\"\n\n---\n\n## 6. The \"Spend\" Vulnerability: Mempool Exposure\n\nAny Bitcoin address type \u2014 including currently-safe unused P2PKH \u2014 becomes vulnerable during the brief window when a spending transaction is in the mempool. The public key is revealed in the witness or scriptSig, and the transaction sits unconfirmed for approximately 10 minutes.\n\nAs [Checkonchain (December 2025)](https://newsletter.checkonchain.com/p/one-day-satoshis-coins-will-move) describes: \"An attacker could effectively redirect coins from their intended destination to their wallet. This does mean that the time available for this kind of QC attack is much shorter (the ~10 minutes until the transaction is mined) and therefore it requires a considerably more powerful QC than is likely in the next decade.\"\n\nCrucially, [BIP-360](https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/7e26b-bitcoin-quantum-threat-timeline-research) \u2014 Bitcoin's first quantum-resistant proposal \u2014 explicitly does **not** protect against this mempool attack:\n\n> \"BIP-360 has acknowledged limitations. It does not fully solve the problem of 'transient' or 'mempool' attacks.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. Satoshi's Coins: Special Considerations\n\nThe ~1.1 million BTC attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto (per Sergio Demian Lerner's Patoshi analysis; some estimates range as low as ~600K BTC per BitMEX Research) warrants individual analysis:\n\n- **Quantum exposure**: Maximum. P2PK format, public keys permanently visible. Zero need for the attacker to wait for a spend.\n- **Likely lost**: No Satoshi coins have moved since 2010. The overwhelming probability is that the private keys are inaccessible (lost hardware, forgotten passphrase, or deliberate abandonment). This means the coins cannot be migrated to quantum-safe addresses by their owner.\n- **Market signal**: Any movement of Satoshi's coins would be treated as confirmation that ECDSA has been broken, regardless of whether it was by a quantum attacker or Satoshi himself. The [CoinTelegraph analysis](https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:16fb594d6094b:0-what-happens-to-satoshi-s-1m-bitcoin-if-quantum-computers-go-live/) describes this as \"triggering market-wide panic, a bank run on exchanges and an existential crisis.\"\n- **Supply impact**: 1.1 million BTC represents ~5.24% of the 21 million total supply \u2014 equivalent to approximately 3.5 years of current miner issuance.\n\n[Checkonchain (December 2025)](https://newsletter.checkonchain.com/p/one-day-satoshis-coins-will-move) estimates the P2PK UTXO set (38,157 addresses, 1.72M BTC) would take **264 days to drain** at one P2PK spend per block.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Policy Debate: Burn, Freeze, or Law of the Jungle?\n\nThe vulnerability of lost P2PK coins has sparked a contentious debate in the Bitcoin community:\n\n- **\"Burn\" option**: Via consensus change, freeze or make unspendable all P2PK UTXOs after a defined block height before a CRQC exists. The principle: better to lose these coins than allow a quantum attacker to weaponize them.\n- **\"Law of the jungle\" option**: Do nothing. If a CRQC appears, whoever uses it first \"wins\" the exposed coins. The principle: Bitcoin's rules should not change to effectively confiscate anyone's funds.\n- **\"Freeze with recovery\" option**: Freeze quantum-vulnerable outputs but provide multiple recovery paths for legitimate owners. [BitMEX Research (February 2026)](https://www.bitmex.com/blog/Mitigating-The-Impact-Of-The-Quantum-Freeze) proposed four such methods: (1) Commitment Recovery (hash commitment + 100-block reveal), (2) Seed Phrase Commitment (leveraging BIP-39's quantum-safe PBKDF2/SHA-512 derivation), (3) Pre-QDay Commitment (Merkle root commitment before QDay \u2014 applicable to Satoshi's coins), and (4) STARK-based ZKP Seed Phrase Method (no advance preparation needed, reusable). BitMEX concluded that combining these methods could make \"almost every quasi frozen coin potentially recoverable\" \u2014 only P2PK coins created before seed phrases existed and without pre-QDay commitment would be truly unrecoverable.\n\nBoth the pure-burn and pure-jungle positions have principled advocates. The [Checkonchain analysis (December 2025)](https://newsletter.checkonchain.com/p/one-day-satoshis-coins-will-move) finds the burn option \"opposed\" because \"the owner of lost and vulnerable coins probably doesn't want anyone else to have access to them either.\" The BitMEX recovery framework offers a potential middle ground, though the required soft fork complexity and node operator burden remain significant counterarguments.\n\n### UTXO Distribution with Recovery Method Mapping\n\n[BitMEX Research (February 2026)](https://www.bitmex.com/blog/Mitigating-The-Impact-Of-The-Quantum-Freeze) published the following comprehensive UTXO breakdown sourced from [Dune Analytics / murchandamus](https://dune.com/murchandamus/bitcoins-utxo-set), mapping each output type to applicable quantum-safe recovery options:\n\n| Output Type | BTC | Supply % | Freeze Mitigation Options |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| P2WPKH | 8,011,484 | 40.1% | Commitment, Seed Phrase Commitment, ZKP Seed Phrase |\n| P2PKH | 4,709,800 | 23.6% | Commitment, Seed Phrase Commitment, ZKP Seed Phrase |\n| P2SH | 4,045,377 | 20.3% | Commitment, Seed Phrase Commitment, ZKP Seed Phrase |\n| P2WSH | 1,296,835 | 6.5% | Commitment, Seed Phrase Commitment, ZKP Seed Phrase |\n| P2PK | 1,716,419 | 8.6% | Pre-QDay Commitment only |\n| Taproot | 196,292 | 1.0% | Seed Phrase Commitment, ZKP Seed Phrase |\n| New quantum safe output | 0 | 0.0% | None required |\n| **Total** | **19,976,207** | **100.0%** | |\n\n*Source: [Dune Analytics / murchandamus](https://dune.com/murchandamus/bitcoins-utxo-set), published by [BitMEX Research (Feb 2026)](https://www.bitmex.com/blog/Mitigating-The-Impact-Of-The-Quantum-Freeze)*\n\nKey insight from this table: approximately 90.5% of the Bitcoin supply (P2WPKH + P2PKH + P2SH + P2WSH) would have access to all three recovery methods, including the ZKP method that requires no advance preparation. Only the 8.6% in P2PK \u2014 largely Satoshi-era coins \u2014 is limited to the Pre-QDay Commitment method.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n1. Chaincode Labs.

Points of Consensus Across the Literature\n\n### 1.1 ECDSA Is Broken in Polynomial Time by Shor's Algorithm\n\nEvery paper reviewed agrees on the fundamental cryptographic claim: Shor's algorithm, running on a sufficiently large fault-tolerant quantum computer, solves the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) in polynomial time. This breaks ECDSA completely \u2014 an adversary with a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) can derive any private key from the corresponding public key. There is **no dispute** on this theoretical point in the peer-reviewed literature.\n\n*Key papers:* [Proos & Zalka (2003/2004)](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301141), [R\u00f6tteler et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-70697-9_9), [Aggarwal et al. (2017/2018)](https://doi.org/10.5195/ledger.2018.127)\n\n### 1.2 ECC Is an Easier Target Than RSA for Quantum Attack\n\nMultiple independent analyses confirm that breaking a 256-bit elliptic curve key requires fewer logical qubits than breaking a comparably secure RSA key. Proos & Zalka (2003) showed 1,000 qubits suffice for 160-bit ECC versus 2,000 qubits for 1,024-bit RSA. R\u00f6tteler et al. (2017) confirmed this at the 256-bit level: 2,330 qubits for P-256 vs. ~4,000+ for RSA-3072 (comparable classical security). This consensus implies Bitcoin's ECDSA will be compromised before most RSA-protected infrastructure, all else equal.\n\n*Key papers:* [Proos & Zalka (2003/2004)](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301141), [R\u00f6tteler et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-70697-9_9), [Gheorghiu & Mosca (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02332)\n\n### 1.3 Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work Is Substantially More Quantum-Resistant Than Its Signature Scheme\n\nAll Bitcoin-specific analyses agree that SHA-256 proof-of-work faces only a quadratic speedup from Grover's algorithm (not the polynomial speedup of Shor's on ECDSA), and that this quadratic speedup is easily offset by increasing mining difficulty. Aggarwal et al. (2017) quantified this: ASIC mining rigs' clock speeds far exceed near-term quantum computer operational frequencies, making PoW attacks impractical for the foreseeable future. Kiayias et al. (2023) formalized this with a proof of quantum hardness for the chain-of-PoWs problem.\n\n*Key papers:* [Aggarwal et al. (2017/2018)](https://doi.org/10.5195/ledger.2018.127), [Kiayias et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2023-03-09-944), [Kearney & Perez-Delgado (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.array.2021.100065)\n\n### 1.4 Lattice-Based Signatures Are the Most Practical Near-Term ECDSA Replacement\n\nThe dominant post-quantum signature family recommended across the literature for blockchain use is lattice-based: specifically CRYSTALS-Dilithium (now ML-DSA / NIST FIPS 204) and Falcon (now FN-DSA / NIST FIPS 206). Fern\u00e1ndez-Caram\u00e8s & Fraga-Lamas (2020) identify Dilithium as fastest and Falcon as most compact. Seck & Roux-Langlois (2025) demonstrate BIP32 wallet compatibility for Dilithium. The NIST standardization of both schemes in 2024 has moved this from theoretical preference to official recommendation.\n\n*Key papers:* [Fern\u00e1ndez-Caram\u00e8s & Fraga-Lamas (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2968985), [Seck & Roux-Langlois (2025)](https://doi.org/10.62056/ak5wom2hd), [Allende et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32701-6)\n\n### 1.5 Bitcoin Must Begin Transition Before the Threat Materializes\n\nEvery migration-focused paper agrees that the transition to post-quantum signatures must start before a CRQC becomes available, not after. Campagna et al. (2021) note that cryptographic transitions take 10\u201320 years. Pont et al. (2024) calculate a minimum 76-day downtime requirement just for the technical migration. The combination of long preparation time and hard deadline creates a planning emergency even if the threat is 10+ years away.\n\n*Key papers:* [Campagna et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01269), [Pont et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16965), [Zamyatin et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.180410)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Points of Disagreement\n\n### 2.1 Timeline Estimates Vary by More Than a Decade\n\nThis is the single largest source of disagreement in the literature. Estimates for when a CRQC capable of breaking Bitcoin's ECDSA might be available range from **2027 (optimistic) to 2035+ (conservative)**:\n\n| Source | Timeline | Basis |\n|--------|----------|-------|\n| Aggarwal et al. (2017) | As early as 2027 | Optimistic quantum hardware extrapolation |\n| Zamyatin et al. (2018) | ~2025\u20132030 | Logical qubit trajectory |\n| Kearney & Perez-Delgado (2021) | ~2035 | RSA-2048 break estimate (ECC easier, so perhaps 2030\u20132033) |\n| Webber et al. (2022) | \"Within 10 years\" of 2022 (i.e., by ~2032) | Physical qubit estimate requiring 13M qubits (1-day break) |\n| Pont et al. (2024) | Within a decade of 2024 | Reasonable probability framing |\n| Baseri et al. (2025) | Near-to-mid-term | Qualitative; emphasizes proactive action |\n\nThe wide spread reflects genuine uncertainty about: the pace of qubit scaling (particularly error correction overhead reduction), whether algorithmic improvements will reduce qubit requirements further, and which hardware platform (superconducting, trapped-ion, photonic) will mature fastest. Webber et al. (2022) helpfully frame this as a trade-off space (qubits vs. time) rather than a single prediction.\n\n### 2.2 Logical vs. Physical Qubit Requirements Diverge Significantly\n\nDifferent papers use different measures, creating apparent contradictions. R\u00f6tteler et al. (2017) give **2,330 logical qubits** for P-256. Webber et al. (2022) find **13 million physical qubits** for a 1-day break. Gu et al. (2025) give **4,300 logical qubits** under 2D architectural constraints. These numbers are not inconsistent \u2014 they reflect different error-correction models and architectural assumptions \u2014 but they are frequently misquoted in secondary sources.\n\nThe conversion factor between logical and physical qubits under the surface code is roughly 1,000:1 at current error rates, explaining why ~2,000 logical qubits maps to ~millions of physical qubits. As error rates improve, this ratio decreases, potentially reaching ~100:1, which would put break capability within reach of near-term hardware roadmaps (IBM's 2029\u20132030 targets).\n\n### 2.3 Disagreement on Which Post-Quantum Scheme Bitcoin Should Adopt\n\nWhile there is consensus on lattice-based cryptography as the leading family, papers disagree on the specific scheme:\n\n- **Dilithium / ML-DSA**: Preferred by Fern\u00e1ndez-Caram\u00e8s & Fraga-Lamas (2020) for performance; chosen for BIP32 integration by Seck & Roux-Langlois (2025). Signature size ~2\u20133 KB vs. ECDSA's 64 bytes \u2014 a significant block size increase.\n- **Falcon / FN-DSA**: Preferred by Allende et al. (2023) and Rishikhesh et al. (2023) for smallest signature size (~666 bytes). More complex to implement correctly (Gaussian sampling).\n- **SPHINCS+ / SLH-DSA**: Preferred by those concerned about the security assumption concentration in lattice-based schemes; hash-based security is purely assumption-based. Signature size is prohibitive (~8\u201350 KB).\n- **Hash-based schemes (XMSS, LMS)**: Proposed by Drake et al. (2025) for multi-signature use cases. Statefulness requirements are problematic for Bitcoin's stateless UTXO model.\n\nNo single consensus scheme has emerged for Bitcoin specifically. The optimal choice depends on how Bitcoin weights security assumption diversity vs. block size efficiency vs. implementation simplicity.\n\n### 2.4 Disagreement on Whether the PoW Threat Is Negligible\n\nMost papers treat the PoW quantum threat (via Grover's algorithm) as manageable with a simple difficulty adjustment. However, Aggarwal et al. (2017) note that in a scenario where quantum computers become extremely fast, mining centralization could occur if a single actor with a CRQC gains a sustained mining advantage. This PoW-specific concern is largely dismissed in later literature but has not been formally disproved.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key Open Questions That Research Hasn't Resolved\n\n### 3.1 When Exactly Will a CRQC Arrive?\n\nThe field has not converged on a probability-weighted timeline. The question is not just \"will it happen\" (consensus: yes) but \"when, with what probability distribution.\" A formal Delphi-style expert elicitation on quantum timeline uncertainty, similar to those conducted for nuclear weapons risk, is absent from the literature. The Webber et al. (2022) framework (qubits vs. runtime trade-off space) is the closest thing to a calibrated uncertainty model.\n\n### 3.2 How Much BTC Is Currently Vulnerable \u2014 With Current Data?\n\nZamyatin et al. (2018) estimated ~33% of BTC was in vulnerable UTXOs as of 2018. This figure has not been rigorously updated to 2025\u20132026 to account for UTXO set changes, the adoption of SegWit and Taproot (which improve quantum resistance for new transactions), and lost coins. A current, blockchain-data-backed vulnerability census is missing from the literature.\n\n### 3.3 Can Bitcoin Governance Coordinate a PQC Migration in Time?\n\nThe technical solutions (CDR protocol, soft-fork transition, Dilithium integration) are reasonably well-developed. What is almost completely absent from the academic literature is analysis of Bitcoin's governance mechanism under adversarial quantum-threat conditions: Will miners, node operators, wallet providers, and exchanges coordinate? What happens to the UTXO set of those who refuse or are unable to migrate? The Pont et al. (2024) downtime calculation assumes successful coordination that the governance literature has not validated.\n\n### 3.4 Are Lattice-Based Security Assumptions Sufficiently Battle-Tested?\n\nThe NIST standardization of ML-DSA and FN-DSA provides significant credibility, but the history of cryptography includes cases where apparently hard problems were broken after standardization (e.g., SHA-1 collision attacks). Several papers note that lattice-based problems (LWE, SIS, NTRU) have not had 50 years of cryptanalytic attention that RSA and ECC have received. This residual uncertainty motivates the argument for hybrid signatures (classical + post-quantum) during the transition period.\n\n### 3.5 How Do SegWit/Taproot Addresses Change the Vulnerability Profile?\n\nModern Bitcoin addresses (native SegWit / bech32, Taproot / P2TR) reveal the public key only when spending a UTXO, unlike P2PK outputs which expose it permanently. However, in the P2WPKH case, the public key is still revealed during spending and must be derivable from the transaction. Under the standard 10-minute block confirmation window, a CRQC still has 10 minutes to derive the private key and front-run the transaction. The specific quantum security properties of different Bitcoin address types are not comprehensively analyzed across the literature.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How Estimates Have Evolved Over Time\n\n### 4.1 Qubit Requirements: Initially Understated, Then Recalibrated Upward\n\nThe evolution of qubit estimates shows a pattern of initial optimism followed by more realistic assessments once physical (rather than logical) qubit requirements and architectural constraints are incorporated:\n\n```\nYear    | Authors            | Logical Qubits | Physical Qubits (est.)\n--------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------------\n2003    | Proos & Zalka      | ~1,000 (160-bit) | Not analyzed\n2017    | R\u00f6tteler et al.    | 2,330 (256-bit)  | Not analyzed\n2019    | Gheorghiu & Mosca  | 1,500 (256-bit)  | Variable (hardware-dep.)\n2022    | Webber et al.      | ~2,000           | 13M\u20131.9B (hardware-dep.)\n2025    | Gu et al.          | 4,300 (P-256,2D) | Not analyzed in this form\n2025    | Garn & Kan         | Binary ECC, new benchmarks\n```\n\n**Trend:** Logical qubit estimates have been somewhat revised *upward* from R\u00f6tteler et al.'s widely-cited 2,330 figure (to ~4,300 in Gu et al. 2025) as more realistic 2D architectural constraints are imposed. Physical qubit requirements remain large but have been shown to decrease significantly with improved error correction (from ~1 billion in 2018 estimates to ~13 million in Webber 2022 for a 1-day break). This indicates the threat is *not* becoming more distant \u2014 it is consolidating around a clearer, still-large-but-potentially-achievable target.\n\n### 4.2 Timeline Projections: Not Converging, But Urgency Is Increasing\n\nTimeline estimates have not narrowed; if anything, the range of confident projections spans 2027\u20132035+. However, the **urgency signaling** in the literature has increased dramatically between 2017 and 2025, driven by:\n- The Pont et al. (2024) minimum 76-day downtime calculation establishing a hard lower bound on preparation time\n- The Baseri et al. (2025) and Almuhammadi & Alghamdi (2025) papers emphasizing immediate action\n- NIST finalizing PQC standards in 2024, removing the \"wait for standardization\" excuse\n\nThe practical implication: even if the mean threat timeline has not changed, the tail risk (early CRQC development) and the recognized preparation cost have both moved the literature toward stronger urgency messaging.\n\n### 4.3 Post-Quantum Scheme Recommendations: Narrowing Toward NIST Standards\n\nEarly papers (Aggarwal et al. 2017) surveyed a wide range of candidate schemes including Picnic, qTESLA, and others. The 2024 NIST standardization has significantly narrowed the recommendation landscape. By 2025, virtually all papers recommend ML-DSA (Dilithium), FN-DSA (Falcon), or SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+) \u2014 all NIST-standardized. The diversity of candidate recommendations has collapsed to a more focused choice between these three.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Implications for Bitcoin Specifically\n\n### 5.1 The 10-Minute Attack Window Is the Critical Threshold\n\nBitcoin transactions broadcast to the mempool expose the public key for approximately 10 minutes before confirmation. A CRQC needs to derive the private key within this window to front-run the transaction. Webber et al. (2022) calculate this requires ~1.9 billion physical qubits at 10\u207b\u2076 gate error rates \u2014 the most demanding threshold. For *already-spent* outputs with exposed public keys (P2PK, some P2PKH), there is no time constraint, and any CRQC can retroactively compromise these addresses.\n\n**Bitcoin-specific implication:** The distinction between \"spend-time attack\" (10-minute window) and \"retroactive attack\" (no time limit, exposed public keys) is crucial. Approximately 4\u20135 million BTC in old P2PK outputs and lost/dormant addresses with exposed public keys (including likely Satoshi coins) are vulnerable to retroactive attack regardless of how fast the quantum computer operates.\n\n### 5.2 Block Size Inflation Is a Hard Engineering Constraint\n\nECDSA signatures are 64\u201371 bytes. Post-quantum alternatives are substantially larger:\n- **Falcon-512 / FN-DSA:** ~666 bytes (~10\u00d7 ECDSA)\n- **ML-DSA Level 2:** ~2,420 bytes (~35\u00d7 ECDSA)\n- **SLH-DSA Small:** ~7,856 bytes (~120\u00d7 ECDSA)\n\nBitcoin's current 1 MB base block weight limit (with SegWit's 4 MB max effective weight) means that migrating to even the most compact post-quantum scheme (Falcon) would reduce effective transaction throughput by approximately 10\u00d7. A hard fork to increase block size would be required unless a Taproot-style witness discount is applied to PQC signatures \u2014 itself requiring a soft fork.\n\n*Cross-reference: `../04-signature-schemes/` for detailed size and performance comparisons*\n\n### 5.3 The UTXO Vulnerability Distribution Is Skewed Toward Large, Old Holdings\n\nZamyatin et al. (2018) identified ~1.77M BTC in permanently exposed P2PK outputs. These are predominantly early Bitcoin holdings, including the estimated ~1M BTC attributable to Satoshi Nakamoto. The quantum threat to these specific outputs is particularly acute: they will be compromised as soon as a CRQC arrives, regardless of any migration effort, because no migration can happen without the private key holder's cooperation (and lost coins' holders are definitionally unreachable).\n\n**Bitcoin-specific implication:** A portion of Bitcoin's supply becomes permanently at risk and potentially available to a quantum adversary, creating supply-shock risk independent of the transition success for the remaining network.\n\n### 5.4 Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet Compatibility Is Now Solved\n\nA critical practical blocker \u2014 BIP32 HD wallet compatibility with post-quantum schemes \u2014 has been addressed by Seck & Roux-Langlois (2025)'s DilithiumRK construction. This removes one of the strongest engineering objections to Dilithium adoption and opens the path for hardware wallet manufacturers to begin implementing post-quantum key derivation.\n\n### 5.5 Transition Must Begin Now Given 10\u201320 Year Lead Time\n\nThe most important practical implication from the literature is temporal: the intersection of (quantum threat timeline: ~10 years) and (transition preparation time: 10\u201320 years) leaves essentially zero slack. Campagna et al. (2021) and Pont et al. (2024) converge on the conclusion that Bitcoin's upgrade to quantum-safe protocols needs to begin immediately.\n\n*Cross-reference: `../01-threat-model/` for threat timeline scenarios*\n\n---\n\n## 6. Limitations of Current Research\n\n### 6.1 Physical Hardware Assumptions Are Rapidly Outdating Estimates\n\nResource estimates are acutely sensitive to assumed physical gate error rates, code cycle times, and architectural connectivity. Webber et al. (2022)'s widely-cited 13 million physical qubit figure assumes 10\u207b\u2076 gate error and 1 \u03bcs code cycle \u2014 parameters that will improve. A 10\u00d7 improvement in gate fidelity (to 10\u207b\u2077) could reduce physical qubit requirements by roughly 4\u20135\u00d7. The field lacks a living, continuously updated estimate tied to measured hardware progress.\n\n### 6.2 Most Papers Analyze Logical-Level Resources Only\n\nR\u00f6tteler et al. (2017) and most subsequent circuit-level analyses work at the logical qubit level and do not translate to physical resource requirements. The gap between logical and physical analysis is substantial and depends on choices (error correction code, architecture, threshold fidelity) that are still being actively researched. Only Webber et al. (2022) and Gheorghiu & Mosca (2019) systematically bridge this gap.\n\n### 6.3 Algorithmic Improvements to Shor's ECDLP Algorithm Are Not Fully Incorporated\n\nRecent circuit optimizations \u2014 windowed approaches (Garn & Kan 2025), carry-lookahead adders (Gu et al. 2025), dynamic circuit techniques \u2014 have reduced resource estimates in some dimensions while increasing them in others. The field has not yet converged on a single \"best circuit\" for ECDLP, meaning all current estimates have a margin of uncertainty from future algorithmic improvements. History suggests these improvements will reduce, not increase, resource requirements over time.\n\n### 6.4 Economic and Game-Theoretic Analysis Is Largely Absent\n\nWith the exception of Weinberg et al. (2024) on CBDC competition and Rohde et al. (2021) on blockchain prediction markets for quantum technology, the literature is almost entirely technical. Key economic questions are unresolved:\n- What is the rational response of a Bitcoin holder given a 10% annual probability of CRQC arrival?\n- What happens to Bitcoin's price during a credible CRQC announcement?\n- How does the 4\u20135 million BTC in potentially compromised Satoshi/lost coins affect market dynamics?\n- Will quantum arms-race dynamics (nation-states hiding CRQC capability) change the effective threat timeline?\n\n### 6.5 The Governance and Coordination Problem Is Understudied\n\nTechnical migration proposals (CDR, soft-fork protocols) assume successful network coordination. Bitcoin's upgrade history (SegWit activation taking 2+ years, block size wars, Taproot activation) suggests coordination on security-critical protocol changes is extremely difficult. No paper in the current literature performs a realistic governance simulation for the quantum migration scenario, including the adversarial possibility that a CRQC holder actively works to delay the migration.\n\n### 6.6 Cryptographic Agility in Bitcoin Is Limited by Design\n\nBitcoin's protocol design provides limited cryptographic agility \u2014 the ability to swap signature schemes without breaking backward compatibility. The immutability properties that make Bitcoin valuable are the same properties that make migration expensive. Papers acknowledge this constraint but do not fully analyze the design modifications (Script version opcodes, witness type expansion) that would be needed to enable agility without invalidating existing UTXOs.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Consensus Threat Model Summary\n\nDrawing across all reviewed papers, the consensus view can be summarized as:\n\n| Threat Vector | Consensus Risk Level | Timeline to Critical Risk | Research Certainty |\n|--------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|\n| ECDSA private key recovery (Shor's) | **Critical** | 2027\u20132035 | High (theoretical) |\n| Retroactive attack on exposed public keys | **Critical** | Same as above | High |\n| PoW 51% attack via Grover's | **Low-Moderate** | >2035 (adjustable by difficulty) | High |\n| SHA-256 preimage resistance degradation | **Low** | Far future | High |\n| Hash function collision resistance | **Negligible** | Far future | High |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Research Gaps and Recommended Future Work\n\nBased on the literature synthesis, the following research gaps are identified as most critical for Bitcoin's quantum security planning:\n\n1. **Updated UTXO vulnerability census (2025):** A current, on-chain analysis of how many BTC are in addresses with exposed or recoverable public keys, segmented by address type and quantum-attack timeline.\n\n2. **Governance simulation:** Agent-based modeling of Bitcoin's upgrade coordination process under quantum threat conditions, including adversarial actors.\n\n3. **Hybrid signature performance benchmarks:** Real implementation benchmarks for hybrid (ECDSA + ML-DSA or ECDSA + FN-DSA) transaction signatures on Bitcoin testnet, measuring throughput, memory, and block-size impact.\n\n4. **Physical qubit estimate tracker:** A living document tracking the Webber-style physical qubit requirements as error rates, code cycle times, and architectural assumptions evolve with actual hardware.\n\n5. **Economic risk modeling:** Formal analysis of how a credible quantum threat announcement would affect Bitcoin markets, UTXO migration rates, and mining incentives.\n\n---\n\n*End of synthesis document.*  \n*See `paper-summaries.md` for full annotated bibliography.*  \n*Cross-references: `../01-threat-model/` | `../04-signature-schemes/`*\n",
  "02-academic-research/paper-summaries": "# Annotated Bibliography: Quantum Computing Threats to Bitcoin and Elliptic Curve Cryptography\n\n\n> **Last updated:** February 28, 2026 | **Confidence shelf-life:** 2 years (academic papers, stable)\n\n\n**Compiled:** 2026-02-28  \n**Scope:** Academic papers spanning 2003\u20132026 on quantum threats to Bitcoin, ECDSA, and ECC; post-quantum signature schemes; resource estimation; and migration strategies.  \n**Total papers:** 22  \n\n---\n\n## Category 1: Quantum Attacks on ECC/ECDSA\n\n---\n\n### Paper 1.1\n\n**Title:** Shor's Discrete Logarithm Quantum Algorithm for Elliptic Curves  \n**Authors:** John Proos, Christof Zalka  \n**Date:** January 2003 (published 2004)  \n**Venue:** *Quantum Information and Computation*, Vol. 3, No. 4, pp. 317\u2013344  \n**DOI/URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301141  \n**Source Quality:** [Peer-reviewed]\n\n**Summary:** This foundational paper demonstrates that Shor's efficient quantum algorithm for discrete logarithms can be adapted for elliptic curve groups over GF(p). The authors provide a detailed implementation analysis and conclude that a 160-bit elliptic curve cryptographic key could be broken with approximately 1,000 logical qubits, whereas factoring the security-equivalent 1,024-bit RSA modulus requires roughly 2,000 qubits. The key finding is that ECDLP is a substantially *easier* target for quantum attack than RSA factoring at comparable classical security levels \u2014 a conclusion that has set the agenda for subsequent resource-estimation work.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Bitcoin uses ECDSA on the secp256k1 curve (256-bit key). Proos and Zalka's foundational analysis implies that 256-bit ECC is directly breakable with Shor's algorithm on a sufficiently large fault-tolerant quantum computer, and that the qubit overhead is lower than for RSA, making Bitcoin's signature scheme a priority target.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 1.2\n\n**Title:** On the Design and Optimization of a Quantum Polynomial-Time Attack on Elliptic Curve Cryptography  \n**Authors:** Donny Cheung, Dmitri Maslov, Jimson Mathew, Dhiraj K. Pradhan  \n**Date:** 2007 (arXiv); published 2009  \n**Venue:** arXiv:0710.1093  \n**DOI/URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.1093  \n**Source Quality:** [Preprint]\n\n**Summary:** This paper extends earlier quantum circuit designs for elliptic curve groups over GF(2^m), constructing an efficient quantum circuit for binary field multiplication and using projective coordinates to reduce qubit and gate requirements over GF(2^m) curves. The work improves on Proos-Zalka by reducing circuit depth, showing that algorithmic optimizations can materially lower resource demands for quantum ECDLP attacks.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Bitcoin uses prime-field ECC (secp256k1 over GF(p)), so the binary-field analysis here is not directly applicable; however, the circuit-optimization methodology directly informed the broader research program on reducing quantum resource requirements that led to the Roetteler et al. (2017) estimates for prime-field ECDSA.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 1.3\n\n**Title:** Quantum Attacks on Bitcoin, and How to Protect Against Them  \n**Authors:** Divesh Aggarwal, Gavin K. Brennen, Troy Lee, Miklos Santha, Marco Tomamichel  \n**Date:** October 28, 2017  \n**Venue:** *Ledger*, Vol. 3 (2018); arXiv:1710.10377  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.5195/ledger.2018.127 | https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10377  \n**Source Quality:** [Peer-reviewed]\n\n**Summary:** This landmark paper is the first comprehensive, Bitcoin-specific quantum threat analysis. The authors reach two major conclusions: (1) Bitcoin's SHA-256 proof-of-work is relatively resistant to quantum speedup for at least 10 years from 2017 because specialized ASIC miners operate far faster than near-term quantum computers; (2) Bitcoin's ECDSA signature scheme is far more vulnerable and could be completely broken by a quantum computer as early as 2027 under optimistic assumptions. They propose using Momentum \u2014 a collision-finding proof-of-work \u2014 as a quantum-harder alternative and survey available post-quantum signature schemes (XMSS, SPHINCS, Picnic, etc.) for their suitability in blockchain contexts.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Directly and exclusively focused on Bitcoin. Provides the earliest timeline estimate (circa 2027) for ECDSA breakage and explicitly evaluates which post-quantum signature schemes best fit Bitcoin's throughput, block-size, and key-management constraints.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 1.4\n\n**Title:** ECDSA Cracking Methods  \n**Authors:** William J. Buchanan, Jamie Gilchrist, Keir Finlow-Bates  \n**Date:** April 9, 2025  \n**Venue:** arXiv:2504.07265  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.07265  \n**Source Quality:** [Preprint]\n\n**Summary:** A technical survey of all known methods to break ECDSA signatures \u2014 including nonce reuse, weak nonce choice, revealed nonces, fault attacks, and quantum (Shor-based) attacks \u2014 providing a unified threat taxonomy for ECDSA. The paper demonstrates that classical attacks (nonce misuse) remain immediately actionable and critically underlines that the quantum threat via Shor's algorithm is the only known attack capable of breaking a correctly-implemented, quantum-era ECDSA.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Bitcoin and Ethereum both depend on ECDSA. The paper contextualizes the quantum threat alongside classical attack surfaces, helping practitioners prioritize mitigations and understand which threat is acute now versus future-state.\n\n---\n\n## Category 2: Resource Estimates for Quantum Attacks\n\n---\n\n### Paper 2.1\n\n**Title:** Quantum Resource Estimates for Computing Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithms  \n**Authors:** Martin R\u00f6tteler, Michael Naehrig, Krysta M. Svore, Kristin Lauter  \n**Date:** June 2017 (arXiv); presented December 2017  \n**Venue:** *ASIACRYPT 2017*, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 10625, pp. 241\u2013270  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-70697-9_9 | https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06752  \n**Source Quality:** [Conference] [Peer-reviewed]\n\n**Summary:** The definitive resource-estimation paper for Shor's ECDLP algorithm on prime-field elliptic curves, produced by Microsoft Research. Using the LIQUi|\u27e9 quantum simulation framework, the authors derive that a 256-bit curve (secp256k1 / NIST P-256) can be broken with **2,330 logical qubits** and approximately **1.26 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u00b9 Toffoli gates**. The general formula is: at most 9n + 2\u2308log\u2082(n)\u2309 + 10 qubits for an n-bit prime-field curve. The paper further confirms that attacking ECC requires significantly fewer qubits than attacking RSA at equivalent classical security levels, reinforcing the finding of Proos-Zalka.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Bitcoin's secp256k1 curve is a 256-bit prime-field curve, directly matching the P-256 analysis. The 2,330-logical-qubit figure became the canonical reference estimate in nearly all subsequent Bitcoin quantum-threat literature and standardization discussions.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 2.2\n\n**Title:** The Impact of Hardware Specifications on Reaching Quantum Advantage in the Fault Tolerant Regime  \n**Authors:** Mark Webber, Vincent Elfving, Sebastian Weidt, Winfried K. Hensinger  \n**Date:** January 2022  \n**Venue:** *AVS Quantum Science*, Vol. 4, No. 1, Article 013801  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.1116/5.0073075  \n**Source Quality:** [Peer-reviewed]\n\n**Summary:** Produced by Universal Quantum and the University of Sussex, this paper calculates physical (not logical) qubit requirements to break Bitcoin's 256-bit ECDSA, finding: **13 million physical qubits** are needed to break Bitcoin encryption within **1 day**; **317 million** within 1 hour; and **1.9 billion** within 10 minutes (all at 1 \u03bcs code cycle time with 10\u207b\u2076 physical gate error). Given that state-of-the-art quantum computers in 2022 had only 50\u2013100 qubits, the paper concludes Bitcoin is safe for now but that quantum advantage could arrive in \"as little as 10 years.\" The paper also demonstrates that parallelizing via more qubits can compensate for slower clock speeds, providing hardware-agnostic attack timelines.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** The most widely cited quantitative estimate for the *physical* qubit cost of breaking Bitcoin. Establishes that the 10-minute transaction window is the critical threshold: a quantum computer must derive a private key before the transaction is confirmed, which requires ~1.9 billion physical qubits at 10\u207b\u2076 error rates \u2014 far beyond current hardware but within projected 10-year roadmaps.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 2.3\n\n**Title:** Benchmarking the Quantum Cryptanalysis of Symmetric, Public-Key and Hash-Based Cryptographic Schemes  \n**Authors:** Vlad Gheorghiu, Michele Mosca  \n**Date:** February 2019  \n**Venue:** arXiv:1902.02332  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1902.02332  \n**Source Quality:** [Preprint]\n\n**Summary:** A comprehensive benchmarking study from the University of Waterloo and evolutionQ that provides physical-level resource estimates for quantum attacks on RSA, ECC, AES, and hash-based schemes under various assumptions. For 256-bit ECC they find approximately 1,500 logical qubits are required. The paper also bounds the potential impact of future circuit optimizations and provides estimates under varying quantum hardware assumptions, offering a cross-scheme comparison that places ECC attacks in context with attacks on symmetric cryptography.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Provides an independent logical-qubit estimate (1,500 for 256-bit ECC) that complements Roetteler et al.'s 2,330 estimate, explaining some of the variance in the literature. The cross-scheme comparison clarifies that SHA-256 (Bitcoin's PoW hash) is only weakened quadratically by Grover's algorithm, while ECDSA is broken polynomially by Shor's \u2014 a critical distinction for Bitcoin threat modeling.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 2.4\n\n**Title:** Resource Analysis of Shor's Elliptic Curve Algorithm with an Improved Quantum Adder on a Two-Dimensional Lattice  \n**Authors:** Quan Gu, Han Ye, Junjie Chen, Xiongfeng Ma  \n**Date:** 2025  \n**Venue:** arXiv / Semantic Scholar  \n**DOI/URL:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/caf8e5bc54e841ffd4e1b771e050525a0fb80469  \n**Source Quality:** [Preprint]\n\n**Summary:** The most recent comprehensive resource analysis (2025), proposing a carry-lookahead quantum adder with Toffoli depth log n + log log n + O(1) using only O(n) ancillas, compatible with 2D nearest-neighbor architectures. For the NIST P-256 curve (which underlies Bitcoin's ECDSA), the paper estimates approximately **4,300 logical qubits** with Toffoli fidelity ~10\u207b\u2079 are sufficient. This is a significant increase from Roetteler et al.'s 2,330 figure but reflects more realistic 2D architectural constraints, establishing new benchmarks for fault-tolerant hardware requirements.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Directly analyzes NIST P-256 / secp256k1 parameters. The 2025 result represents the state-of-the-art physical constraint estimate, suggesting that logical qubit requirements are larger (not smaller) once realistic 2D connectivity is imposed \u2014 somewhat increasing the time horizon for Bitcoin vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 2.5\n\n**Title:** Quantum Resource Estimates for Computing Binary Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithms  \n**Authors:** Michael Garn, A. Kan  \n**Date:** March 4, 2025  \n**Venue:** *IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering*, 2025  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.1109/TQE.2025.3586541  \n**Source Quality:** [Peer-reviewed]\n\n**Summary:** Performs logical and physical resource estimation for binary-field ECDLP using a windowed approach with exact point-addition implementation including all exceptional cases. Compares surface-code matter-based and photonic fusion-based quantum computer architectures, finding the photonic active-volume architecture runs 2\u201320\u00d7 faster depending on operating regime. Provides exact logical gate and qubit counts for cryptographically relevant binary field sizes.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Although Bitcoin uses prime-field ECC (not binary-field), the methodological advances \u2014 particularly exact circuit implementation and architectural comparison \u2014 directly inform prime-field resource estimates and demonstrate that architectural choices (photonic vs. trapped-ion) can dramatically affect attack timelines.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 2.6\n\n**Title:** Vulnerability of Blockchain Technologies to Quantum Attacks  \n**Authors:** Joseph J. Kearney, Carlos A. Perez-Delgado  \n**Date:** May 5, 2021  \n**Venue:** *Array*, Vol. 10, 100065, 2021; arXiv:2105.01815  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.array.2021.100065  \n**Source Quality:** [Peer-reviewed]\n\n**Summary:** Provides a comparative vulnerability analysis across major cryptocurrencies \u2014 Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and ZCash \u2014 determining their relative exposure to quantum attacks. The paper distinguishes between protocols that are and are not vulnerable (not all blockchain components are equally at risk) and gives a 2035 timeline estimate for a quantum computer capable of breaking RSA-2048. The nuanced finding is that while ECDSA-based signing is critically vulnerable, proof-of-work and hash functions face only quadratic degradation.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Bitcoin-specific and one of the most cited comparative analyses. The 2035 estimate for RSA-2048 breakage \u2014 with ECDSA-256 likely breaking sooner due to lower qubit requirements \u2014 provides one of the more conservative timeline projections in the literature.\n\n---\n\n## Category 3: Post-Quantum Signature Schemes for Blockchain\n\n---\n\n### Paper 3.1\n\n**Title:** Towards Post-Quantum Bitcoin Blockchain using Dilithium Signature  \n**Authors:** Michel Seck, Adeline Roux-Langlois  \n**Date:** October 6, 2025  \n**Venue:** *IACR Communications in Cryptology*, Vol. 2, No. 3  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.62056/ak5wom2hd  \n**Source Quality:** [Peer-reviewed]\n\n**Summary:** The most recent and comprehensive analysis of replacing Bitcoin's ECDSA with Dilithium (now standardized as ML-DSA / NIST FIPS 204). The authors design DilithiumRK, a variant with rerandomizable keys that enables BIP32-compatible hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets \u2014 a critical gap that prior lattice-based proposals had not addressed. Security analysis and implementation of DilithiumRK are provided, demonstrating practical feasibility of the ECDSA\u2192Dilithium migration for the full Bitcoin wallet ecosystem.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Directly solves the BIP32 HD wallet compatibility problem, which is one of the most overlooked practical obstacles to Bitcoin's post-quantum migration. The IACR venue provides strong peer-review credibility, and ML-DSA is now an official NIST standard.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 3.2\n\n**Title:** Towards Post-Quantum Blockchain: A Review on Blockchain Cryptography Resistant to Quantum Computing Attacks  \n**Authors:** Tiago M. Fern\u00e1ndez-Caram\u00e8s, Paula Fraga-Lamas  \n**Date:** 2020 (Volume 11)  \n**Venue:** *IEEE Access*, Vol. 11  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2968985  \n**Source Quality:** [Peer-reviewed]\n\n**Summary:** The most comprehensive survey paper in the field, reviewing all NIST PQC Round 2 candidates for blockchain applicability. Key finding: lattice-based schemes (CRYSTALS-Dilithium for fastest AVX2 performance; Falcon for smallest key/signature sizes) are the most practical near-term replacements for ECDSA in blockchain contexts. Code-based schemes have prohibitive key sizes; hash-based schemes (SPHINCS+, XMSS) have large signature sizes and/or statefulness issues. The paper provides comparison tables on performance, key/signature sizes, and security assumptions across families, and calls for proactive standardization adoption.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Directly evaluates ECDSA alternatives against blockchain-specific constraints (limited block space, transaction throughput, node bandwidth). Explicitly addresses Bitcoin and Ethereum. Falcon's compact signature sizes are highlighted as particularly Bitcoin-relevant given block-size constraints.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 3.3\n\n**Title:** Quantum-Resistance in Blockchain Networks  \n**Authors:** Marcos Allende, Diego L\u00f3pez Le\u00f3n, Sergio Cer\u00f3n, Antonio Leal, Adriana Pareja, Marcelo Da Silva, Alejandro Pardo, Duncan Jones, David Worrall, Ben Merriman, Jonathan Gilmore, Nick Kitchener, Salvador E. Venegas-Andraca  \n**Date:** April 6, 2023  \n**Venue:** *Scientific Reports*, Vol. 13, Article 5664  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32701-6  \n**Source Quality:** [Peer-reviewed]\n\n**Summary:** Presents an end-to-end post-quantum blockchain framework implemented in an Ethereum-based (EVM-compatible) network, using Falcon-512 as the post-quantum signature and quantum entropy for key generation. The paper is notable for being the first to implement on-chain verification of post-quantum signatures via three mechanisms: Solidity smart contracts, modified EVM opcode, and precompiled contracts \u2014 enabling direct comparison of overhead across approaches. The authors find that post-quantum TLS (without requiring a full QKD network) is technically feasible today.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** While Ethereum-focused, the implementation directly addresses architectural questions applicable to Bitcoin: signature verification overhead, block size impact, and protocol-layer integration of PQC. The Falcon-512 choice \u2014 a NIST-selected scheme \u2014 provides a concrete technical blueprint.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 3.4\n\n**Title:** A Quantum-Resistant Blockchain System: A Comparative Analysis  \n**Authors:** A. Rishikhesh, Gyanendra Prasad Joshi, Joel Marion Marceline, P. Thanalakshmi, Woong Cho  \n**Date:** September 17, 2023  \n**Venue:** *Mathematics*, Vol. 11, No. 18, 3947  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.3390/math11183947  \n**Source Quality:** [Peer-reviewed]\n\n**Summary:** Benchmarks NIST-recommended post-quantum signatures (Dilithium, Falcon, SPHINCS+) against ECDSA in a Bitcoin exchange scheme, using IPFS to offload signature and public key storage to reduce on-chain overhead. The study shows SPHINCS+ has the largest signatures (approximately 8 KB vs. approximately 64 bytes for ECDSA) but the strongest security assumptions; Falcon achieves the most compact signatures (approximately 0.7 KB) with lattice-based security; Dilithium balances security and performance. The IPFS approach significantly reduces block size inflation.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Provides quantitative performance benchmarks directly relevant to Bitcoin's block size limits and transaction throughput constraints \u2014 the key engineering trade-off in any Bitcoin post-quantum migration.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 3.5\n\n**Title:** Hash-Based Multi-Signatures for Post-Quantum Ethereum  \n**Authors:** Justin Drake, Dmitry Khovratovich, Mikhail A. Kudinov, Benedikt Wagner  \n**Date:** April 8, 2025  \n**Venue:** *IACR Communications in Cryptology*, Vol. 2, No. 1, Article 13  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.62056/aey7qjp10  \n**Source Quality:** [Peer-reviewed]\n\n**Summary:** Proposes a family of XMSS-based hash-based signature schemes as post-quantum alternatives to BLS multi-signatures in Ethereum's proof-of-stake consensus. The paper introduces a unified framework for XMSS variants that minimizes security loss, avoids random oracle assumptions, and defines standard model requirements for hash functions \u2014 enabling cryptanalysts to precisely assess security. Provides concrete parameter recommendations.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** While Ethereum-focused on multi-signatures, the XMSS-based approach and the treatment of statefulness challenges apply directly to Bitcoin's Taproot multi-signature and threshold wallet designs. The IACR peer-reviewed venue provides strong credibility.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 3.6\n\n**Title:** Performance Analysis and Evaluation of Post Quantum Secure Blockchained Federated Learning  \n**Authors:** Dev Gurung, Shiva Raj Pokhrel, Gang Li  \n**Date:** July 2023  \n**Venue:** arXiv:2306.14772  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.14772  \n**Source Quality:** [Preprint]\n\n**Summary:** Proposes a hybrid approach combining stateless lattice-based signatures (Dilithium or Falcon) with stateful hash-based signatures (XMSS) in a blockchain-based federated learning system. The paper evaluates performance under real blockchain conditions and finds that pure lattice-based schemes perform comparably to ECDSA for signing speed but incur 3\u201310\u00d7 overhead in signature verification throughput. The hybrid approach reduces the statefulness burden of hash-based schemes while providing defense in depth.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** The hybrid signature approach directly addresses Bitcoin's requirement to maintain performance under high transaction volumes, and the quantitative overhead analysis informs the scaling cost of any Bitcoin PQC migration.\n\n---\n\n## Category 4: Bitcoin-Specific Quantum Threat Analyses\n\n---\n\n### Paper 4.1\n\n**Title:** Committing to Quantum Resistance: A Slow Defence for Bitcoin Against a Fast Quantum Computing Attack  \n**Authors:** Alexei Zamyatin, D. Ilie, I. Stewart, M.F. Torshizi, Sam M. Werner, W.J. Knottenbelt  \n**Date:** June 20, 2018  \n**Venue:** *Royal Society Open Science*, Vol. 5, No. 6  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.180410  \n**Source Quality:** [Peer-reviewed]\n\n**Summary:** Analyzes Bitcoin's specific exposure to quantum attack and proposes the commit\u2013delay\u2013reveal (CDR) transition protocol. Key vulnerability data: approximately 1.77 million BTC in P2PK UTXOs (public key directly exposed); approximately 3.9 million BTC in P2PKH/P2SH UTXOs vulnerable upon spending. The CDR protocol allows users to commit to a post-quantum key, wait 6 months to prevent chain reorganization attacks, then reveal and spend \u2014 functioning even if ECDSA has already been broken. The paper finds the transition works even in a worst-case scenario where the quantum computer arrives before the transition completes.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Directly focused on Bitcoin. The UTXO exposure statistics (approximately 33% of all BTC vulnerable at time of writing) became a widely-cited benchmark in the threat-modeling literature, and the CDR protocol remains one of the leading proposed transition mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 4.2\n\n**Title:** Downtime Required for Bitcoin Quantum-Safety  \n**Authors:** Jamie J. Pont, Joseph J. Kearney, Jack Moyler, Carlos A. Perez-Delgado  \n**Date:** October 22, 2024  \n**Venue:** arXiv:2410.16965  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2410.16965  \n**Source Quality:** [Preprint]\n\n**Summary:** Calculates the technical cost of Bitcoin's quantum-safety upgrade in terms of required network downtime. The authors find a non-tight lower bound of **1,827.96 hours (76.16 days)** of cumulative downtime needed to transition all UTXOs to post-quantum outputs. Critically, the transition must be fully completed before ECDSA-256-breaking quantum devices become available. The conclusion is stark: the upgrade needs to begin as soon as possible given the lead time required versus the plausible quantum threat timeline within the decade.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** One of the most practically useful recent papers. The 76-day minimum downtime estimate is a concrete planning parameter for Bitcoin developers, establishing urgency that abstract threat-level discussions cannot convey.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 4.3\n\n**Title:** Assessment of Quantum Threat to Bitcoin and Derived Cryptocurrencies  \n**Authors:** Stephen Holmes, Liqun Chen  \n**Date:** (undated; circa 2021\u20132022)  \n**Venue:** Semantic Scholar  \n**DOI/URL:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/25e8c19830e5d40a829abb9c9a10462545970d00  \n**Source Quality:** [Technical Report]\n\n**Summary:** Provides a structured risk assessment framework specifically for Bitcoin and Bitcoin-derived cryptocurrencies, distinguishing between the threat to ECDSA (high, polynomial-time via Shor's), the threat to SHA-256 PoW (moderate, quadratic via Grover's), and the threat to mining reward competition. The paper evaluates multiple threat scenarios including optimistic and pessimistic quantum hardware timelines and proposes assessment criteria for cryptocurrency-specific quantum risk.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Focused entirely on Bitcoin and its forks (Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin). The structured risk-scoring methodology provides a practical framework for the Bitcoin development community to prioritize defensive action.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 4.4\n\n**Title:** Blockchain Security Risk Assessment in Quantum Era, Migration Strategies and Proactive Defense  \n**Authors:** Yaser Baseri, Abdelhakim Hafid, Yahya Shahsavari, Dimitrios Makrakis, Hassan Khodaiemehr  \n**Date:** January 21, 2025  \n**Venue:** *IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials*, 2025; arXiv:2501.11798  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2025.3621113  \n**Source Quality:** [Peer-reviewed]\n\n**Summary:** Performs a comprehensive STRIDE-framework threat analysis of quantum vulnerabilities across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and Zcash. Identifies private key compromise (via Shor's), consensus disruption (via Grover's mining advantage), and smart contract integrity risks as the three top quantum threat vectors. Proposes two hybrid migration architectures balancing performance, backward compatibility, and quantum resistance. The 2025 publication date makes this one of the most current systematic surveys.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Bitcoin is explicitly analyzed throughout, with platform-specific vulnerability assessments. The hybrid migration architecture with dual-signature transactions provides a concrete Bitcoin-applicable pathway.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 4.5\n\n**Title:** Quantum Multi-Solution Bernoulli Search with Applications to Bitcoin's Post-Quantum Security  \n**Authors:** Aleksandar Kiayias, Alexandru Cojocaru, Fang Song, Juan Garay, Petros Wallden  \n**Date:** December 30, 2020 (arXiv); published March 9, 2023  \n**Venue:** *Quantum*, Vol. 7, Article 944  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2023-03-09-944  \n**Source Quality:** [Peer-reviewed]\n\n**Summary:** Examines the hardness of Bitcoin's proof-of-work chain specifically against quantum strategies, introducing the quantum multi-solution Bernoulli search problem. The paper proves a formal reduction from the chain-of-PoWs problem to this quantum-hard primitive, providing theoretical grounding for the claim that Bitcoin's PoW is substantially more quantum-resistant than its signature scheme. The result partially formalizes Aggarwal et al.'s (2017) empirical claim about PoW quantum resistance.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Provides the formal theoretical foundation for the PoW vs. ECDSA quantum resistance asymmetry, confirming that Bitcoin's mining security is more robust than its transaction signing security against quantum adversaries.\n\n---\n\n## Category 5: Migration and Transition Strategies\n\n---\n\n### Paper 5.1\n\n**Title:** A Novel Transition Protocol to Post-Quantum Cryptocurrency Blockchains  \n**Authors:** Sultan Almuhammadi, Sarah Alghamdi  \n**Date:** May 21, 2025  \n**Venue:** *Frontiers in Computer Science*, 2025  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomp.2025.1457000  \n**Source Quality:** [Peer-reviewed]\n\n**Summary:** Reviews existing transition protocols for cryptocurrency blockchains (including the Zamyatin CDR protocol) and proposes a new algorithm that achieves smooth migration to post-quantum cryptography via a **soft fork** rather than a hard fork, addressing a major criticism of prior proposals. The soundness and completeness properties of the new protocol are formally proven. The soft-fork approach has significant advantages for Bitcoin governance (lower coordination cost, backward compatibility).\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** The soft-fork mechanism is directly applicable to Bitcoin's upgrade governance model and addresses the risk of chain splits during transition. One of the most recent (2025) and practically useful migration proposals.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 5.2\n\n**Title:** Post Quantum Cryptography: Readiness Challenges and the Approaching Storm  \n**Authors:** Matt Campagna, Brian LaMacchia, David Ott  \n**Date:** January 4, 2021  \n**Venue:** arXiv:2101.01269  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2101.01269  \n**Source Quality:** [Preprint / Technical Report]\n\n**Summary:** A policy-oriented paper from practitioners at AWS, Microsoft, and Google respectively, arguing that cryptographic transitions take 10\u201320 years to complete given infrastructure dependencies, standardization timelines, and deployment complexity. The paper coins the concept of the \"Approaching Storm\" \u2014 the intersection of quantum capability and transition readiness \u2014 and argues the window to begin migration is closing. Identifies blockchain systems as among the hardest to migrate due to decentralized governance and ledger immutability.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Directly relevant for Bitcoin governance: the 10\u201320-year transition timeline argument creates urgency even if quantum hardware threats are 10+ years away, because preparation time is the binding constraint. The paper's blockchain-specific migration challenges analysis identifies Bitcoin's unique governance and UTXO-recovery problems.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 5.3\n\n**Title:** Evaluation of Post-Quantum Distributed Ledger Cryptography  \n**Authors:** Robert Campbell  \n**Date:** March 16, 2019  \n**Venue:** *Journal of the British Blockchain Association (JBBA)*, Vol. 2, No. 1  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.31585/JBBA-2-1-(4)2019  \n**Source Quality:** [Peer-reviewed]\n\n**Summary:** Evaluates ECDSA quantum vulnerability across Bitcoin Core, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and enterprise blockchains (Hyperledger Fabric, Sawtooth Lake) and proposes lattice-based cryptography (then NIST Round 1 candidates) as near-term replacements. The paper is notable for being among the first to call out the specific lack of migration planning in the blockchain industry and to propose coordinated industry-wide lattice-based PQC adoption before NIST final standards. The author argues that waiting for final standards is itself a risk given covert quantum research.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Provides an early, practitioner-oriented analysis of Bitcoin's organizational readiness gap, complementing the more theoretical literature with governance and industry-coordination concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 5.4\n\n**Title:** PMMP \u2014 PQC Migration Management Process  \n**Authors:** Nils von Nethen, Alex Wiesmaier, Nouri Alnahawi, Johanna Henrich  \n**Date:** October 12, 2023 (revised)  \n**Venue:** arXiv:2301.04491  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2301.04491  \n**Source Quality:** [Preprint]\n\n**Summary:** Introduces PMMP, a risk-based process framework for managing the enterprise migration from classical to post-quantum cryptography, integrating with existing organizational steering and control mechanisms (ISMS, risk registers). The framework covers pre-migration inventory, algorithm agility design, parallel operation, and deprecation phases. While enterprise-oriented, the process model applies to the Bitcoin ecosystem's multi-stakeholder migration challenge.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** The PMMP framework maps onto the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process and provides a structured approach that Bitcoin developers and node operators could adapt for a coordinated PQC migration, particularly valuable given Bitcoin's decentralized governance structure.\n\n---\n\n### Paper 5.5\n\n**Title:** Will Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) and Blockchain Cryptocurrencies Coexist in the Post Quantum Era?  \n**Authors:** Abraham Itzhak Weinberg, Pythagoras Petratos, Alessio Faccia  \n**Date:** November 10, 2024  \n**Venue:** arXiv:2411.06362  \n**DOI/URL:** https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.06362  \n**Source Quality:** [Preprint]\n\n**Summary:** Examines the post-quantum landscape for both CBDCs and blockchain cryptocurrencies, analyzing how Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Oblivious Transfer (OT) could provide quantum resistance as alternatives or supplements to PQC digital signatures. The paper argues that the governance structures of CBDCs (centralized, can be patched) give them structural advantage over decentralized cryptocurrencies in the quantum transition, creating a potential competitive displacement risk for Bitcoin.\n\n**Relevance to Bitcoin:** Raises the systemic risk that Bitcoin's governance rigidity could cause it to lag CBDCs in post-quantum readiness, potentially affecting adoption and competitive position \u2014 a socioeconomic dimension often absent from purely technical analyses.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| # | Paper | Year | Category | Source Quality | Key Metric |\n|---|-------|------|----------|---------------|------------|\n| 1.1 | Proos & Zalka | 2003/2004 | Attack | Peer-reviewed | ~1,000 logical qubits for 160-bit ECC |\n| 1.2 | Cheung et al. | 2007/2009 | Attack | Preprint | Circuit optimization for GF(2^m) |\n| 1.3 | Aggarwal et al. | 2017/2018 | Attack | Peer-reviewed | 2027 earliest ECDSA break estimate |\n| 1.4 | Buchanan et al. | 2025 | Attack | Preprint | Classical + quantum ECDSA threat taxonomy |\n| 2.1 | R\u00f6tteler et al. | 2017 | Resource | Conference | 2,330 logical qubits (P-256) |\n| 2.2 | Webber et al. | 2022 | Resource | Peer-reviewed | 13M\u20131.9B physical qubits (1-day to 10-min) |\n| 2.3 | Gheorghiu & Mosca | 2019 | Resource | Preprint | ~1,500 logical qubits (256-bit ECC) |\n| 2.4 | Gu et al. | 2025 | Resource | Preprint | ~4,300 logical qubits (P-256, 2D lattice) |\n| 2.5 | Garn & Kan | 2025 | Resource | Peer-reviewed | Binary ECC resource estimates |\n| 2.6 | Kearney & Perez-Delgado | 2021 | Resource | Peer-reviewed | 2035 RSA-2048 break timeline |\n| 3.1 | Seck & Roux-Langlois | 2025 | PQ Signatures | Peer-reviewed | DilithiumRK + BIP32 compatibility |\n| 3.2 | Fern\u00e1ndez-Caram\u00e8s & Fraga-Lamas | 2020 | PQ Signatures | Peer-reviewed | Comprehensive scheme survey |\n| 3.3 | Allende et al. | 2023 | PQ Signatures | Peer-reviewed | Falcon-512 EVM implementation |\n| 3.4 | Rishikhesh et al. | 2023 | PQ Signatures | Peer-reviewed | Dilithium/Falcon/SPHINCS+ benchmarks |\n| 3.5 | Drake et al. | 2025 | PQ Signatures | Peer-reviewed | XMSS multi-sig for post-quantum Ethereum |\n| 3.6 | Gurung et al. | 2023 | PQ Signatures | Preprint | Hybrid lattice + hash-based approach |\n| 4.1 | Zamyatin et al. | 2018 | Bitcoin-specific | Peer-reviewed | CDR protocol; ~33% BTC at risk |\n| 4.2 | Pont et al. | 2024 | Bitcoin-specific | Preprint | 76.16 days minimum downtime for transition |\n| 4.3 | Holmes & Chen | ~2022 | Bitcoin-specific | Technical Report | Risk assessment framework |\n| 4.4 | Baseri et al. | 2025 | Bitcoin-specific | Peer-reviewed | STRIDE threat model for Bitcoin |\n| 4.5 | Kiayias et al. | 2020/2023 | Bitcoin-specific | Peer-reviewed | Formal PoW quantum hardness proof |\n| 5.1 | Almuhammadi & Alghamdi | 2025 | Migration | Peer-reviewed | Soft-fork transition protocol |\n| 5.2 | Campagna et al. | 2021 | Migration | Technical Report | 10\u201320 year transition timeline |\n| 5.3 | Campbell | 2019 | Migration | Peer-reviewed | Early industry readiness assessment |\n| 5.4 | von Nethen et al. | 2023 | Migration | Preprint | PMMP migration process framework |\n| 5.5 | Weinberg et al. | 2024 | Migration | Preprint | CBDC vs. crypto post-quantum competition |\n\n---\n\n*End of annotated bibliography.

  "03-proposals-and-bips/bip-catalog": "# Bitcoin Quantum-Resistance BIP Catalog\n\n\n> **Last updated:** February 28, 2026 | **Confidence shelf-life:** 3 months (BIP status changes frequently)\n\n\n*Compiled: February 2026 | Scope: All known Bitcoin Improvement Proposals and draft proposals addressing quantum resistance*\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nBitcoin's quantum-resistance effort formally entered the BIP repository in February 2026 when BIP-360 was merged, marking the first time quantum resistance appeared on Bitcoin's official technical roadmap. This catalog documents every known BIP and draft proposal in this space, covering both output-type proposals (address-level hardening) and migration/sunset proposals (ecosystem transition).\n\n---\n\n## BIP-360: Pay-to-Merkle-Root (P2MR)\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **BIP Number** | 360 |\n| **Title** | Pay-to-Merkle-Root (P2MR) |\n| **Authors** | Hunter Beast `<hunter@surmount.systems>`, Ethan Heilman `<ethan.r.heilman@gmail.com>`, Isabel Foxen Duke `<isabel.duke@gmail.com>` |\n| **Status** | Draft |\n| **Layer** | Consensus (soft fork) |\n| **Type** | Standards Track |\n| **Created** | 2024-12-18 |\n| **Merged into BIP repo** | February 11, 2026 |\n| **Current Version** | 0.11.0 |\n| **License** | BSD-3-Clause |\n| **URL** | [https://bip360.org/bip360.html](https://bip360.org/bip360.html) |\n| **GitHub BIP text** | [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) |\n| **Press summary PDF** | [https://bip360.org/assets/press.pdf](https://bip360.org/assets/press.pdf) |\n\n### Summary\n\nBIP-360 proposes a new Bitcoin output type called **Pay-to-Merkle-Root (P2MR)** \u2014 initially named Pay-to-Quantum-Resistant-Hash (P2QRH) and subsequently Pay-to-Tapscript-Hash (P2TSH) before its final naming \u2014 as the first step in a phased \"QuBit\" soft fork series designed to quantum-harden Bitcoin's protocol. The proposal was originally drafted in mid-2024 by Hunter Beast (senior protocol engineer at MARA) and merged into the official BIP repository on February 11, 2026, per [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/bitcoin-advances-toward-quantum-resistance). As noted by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/), BIP-360 addresses Bitcoin's most pressing quantum vulnerability \u2014 the Taproot keypath spend, which permanently exposes a modified public key on-chain \u2014 by replacing it with a Merkle-root-only commitment that hides the public key entirely. The proposal explicitly does **not** introduce any post-quantum signature scheme itself; it builds the structural foundation (SegWit v2 output type) onto which future PQ signature opcodes can be grafted via follow-on soft forks. According to [Chaincode Labs (2025)](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf), as of 2025 approximately 6.26 million BTC resided in addresses vulnerable to long-exposure quantum attacks \u2014 including P2PK addresses (~1.72 million BTC), P2TR/Taproot addresses (~146,715\u2013184,000 BTC), and reused P2PKH/P2WPKH addresses (~4.49 million BTC).\n\n### Key Technical Details\n\n**Output Format**\n\nP2MR is a SegWit version 2 output (the existing SegWit versions are v0 = P2WPKH/P2WSH, v1 = P2TR). The scriptPubKey is:\n```\nOP_2 OP_PUSHBYTES_32 <merkle_root>\n```\nwhere `<merkle_root>` is the tagged-hash (`TapBranch`) Merkle root of the script tree, identical to BIP-341's construction but **without** the Taproot internal public key and tap tweak step.\n\n**Address Format**\n\nBech32m, SegWit v2 \u2192 prefix `bc1z` (e.g., `bc1zzmv50jjgxxhww6ve4g5zpewrkjqhr06fyujpm20tuezdlxmfphcqfc80ve`). The witness version was changed from v3 to v2 in the July 2025 update per the [BIP changelog](https://bip360.org/bip360.html).\n\n**Transaction Structure Changes**\n\n- **Eliminates the key-path spend**: Unlike P2TR, there is no internal public key and no tap tweak. Every P2MR spend is a script-path spend, requiring disclosure of the leaf script, input stack, and a control block.\n- **Control block**: `1 + 32*m` bytes (control byte + Merkle path of depth `m`, 0\u2013128). Control byte parity bit is always 1 (no key path). This results in a minimum witness of **103 bytes** for a depth-0 tree vs. 66 bytes for a P2TR keypath spend \u2014 a size overhead of 37 bytes per input, per the [BIP specification](https://bip360.org/bip360.html).\n- **Signature message**: Identical to BIP-342, maintaining backward compatibility with existing tapscript validation.\n- **Annex support**: Annex bytes (0x50 prefix) are retained for typed fields that future PQ signatures and public keys could use.\n\n**Signature Scheme**\n\nBIP-360 itself introduces **no new signature scheme**. It reuses existing tapscript secp256k1 operations (OP_CHECKSIG with Schnorr). Post-quantum signatures would be added in follow-on BIPs via `OP_SUCCESSx` opcodes or new leaf versions. The implementation library `libbitcoinpqc` ([GitHub](https://github.com/cryptoquick/libbitcoinpqc)) \u2014 a C library with Rust bindings \u2014 has been developed alongside the proposal to implement three NIST-standardized algorithms for future integration:\n\n| Algorithm | NIST Name | Public Key | Signature | NIST Security Level |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| ML-DSA-44 | CRYSTALS-Dilithium | 1,312 bytes | 2,420 bytes | Level 2 |\n| SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s | SPHINCS+ | 32 bytes | 7,856 bytes | Level 1 |\n| FN-DSA-512 | FALCON-512 | 897 bytes | ~666 bytes (avg) | Level 1 |\n\n**Backward Compatibility**\n\nNon-upgraded nodes treat P2MR outputs as anyone-can-spend scripts (standard SegWit behavior), identical to how P2TR appeared to pre-Taproot nodes. This means P2MR is a **pure soft fork** \u2014 old nodes remain valid but do not enforce P2MR spending rules. BIP-360 requires BIPs 340 (Schnorr), 341 (Taproot), and 342 (Tapscript) as dependencies.\n\n**Security Properties**\n\nPer the [BIP-360 specification](https://bip360.org/bip360.html), P2MR provides:\n- **Protection against long-exposure quantum attacks**: Addresses do not expose a public key, unlike P2TR which has the tweaked internal key visible in the scriptPubKey.\n- **No protection against short-exposure attacks**: When spending, the script and any ECC public keys within are revealed in the mempool, creating the same brief window of vulnerability as other address types.\n- Hash security: 256-bit (128-bit collision resistance, 256-bit preimage resistance \u2014 identical to P2WSH from BIP-141).\n\n**Vulnerable Output Comparison**\n\n| Output Type | Long-Exposure Safe | Short-Exposure Safe |\n|---|---|---|\n| P2PK | No | No |\n| P2PKH | Yes* | No |\n| P2MS | No | No |\n| P2SH | Yes* | No |\n| P2WPKH | Yes* | No |\n| P2WSH | Yes* | No |\n| P2TR | **No** (keypath exposes key) | No |\n| P2MR | **Yes** | No (requires PQ sigs) |\n\n*Safe only until first spend, which reveals the public key.\n\n### Community Reception\n\nBIP-360's merge into the official BIP repository on February 11, 2026 was described by [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/bitcoin-advances-toward-quantum-resistance) as \"a new step in efforts to strengthen the network against emerging cryptographic and quantum computing risks,\" with the important caveat that a BIP merge signals neither endorsement nor commitment to activation. Senior Core developers have been largely non-committal: Pieter Wuille (February 2025) stated he \"certainly agree[s] that there is no urgency at present\" but acknowledged that \"if quantum computers capable of breaking cryptography become a reality, the entire ecosystem will have no choice but to disable compromised spending schemes,\" per [FuTu News](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/69055174/). Peter Todd and Adam Back have expressed more skeptical positions, with Back asserting the threat is 20\u201340 years away and manageable via soft forks per [Phemex](https://phemex.com/news/article/adam-back-bitcoin-can-counter-quantum-threats-with-softforks-39152). The Chaincode Labs paper per [ForkLog](https://forklog.com/en/chaincode-labs-sizes-up-the-quantum-threat-to-bitcoin/) notes that Tim Ruffing, Jonas Nick, and Ethan Heilman are \"actively working on Bitcoin's quantum readiness.\" Jonas Nick is notably described as the sole Core developer among the most influential cohort who takes the quantum risk seriously.\n\n---\n\n## Draft BIP: Post-Quantum Migration and Legacy Signature Sunset\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **BIP Number** | Unnumbered (Draft) |\n| **Title** | Post Quantum Migration and Legacy Signature Sunset |\n| **Authors** | Jameson Lopp, Christian Papathanasiou, Ian Smith, Joe Ross, Steve Vaile, Pierre-Luc Dallaire-Demers |\n| **Status** | Draft (submitted July 2025) |\n| **Date** | July 2025 |\n| **URL** | [https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/uEaf4bj07rE](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/uEaf4bj07rE) (mailing list) |\n\n### Summary\n\nThis draft BIP, proposed by Jameson Lopp (Casa co-founder and CSO) and co-authors at the July 2025 Quantum Bitcoin Summit in San Francisco, outlines a phased migration pathway to deprecate legacy ECDSA/Schnorr signatures **after** quantum-resistant output types (specifically P2QRH/BIP-360) have been deployed. It is the most aggressive and socially controversial Bitcoin proposal in recent memory, as it would render billions of dollars in unmigrated coins unspendable. The proposal explicitly builds upon BIP-360 as a prerequisite and targets the ~25% of Bitcoin (roughly 5.25 million BTC with exposed public keys at the time of drafting, per the [Google Groups thread](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/uEaf4bj07rE)). According to coverage by [Quantum Foundry](https://quantumfoundry.substack.com/p/bitcoins-proposed-quantum-resistant), the authors frame the proposal as necessary to prevent \"quantum vampires\" \u2014 entities that gain access to a CRQC and sweep vulnerable addresses \u2014 from causing a massive wealth redistribution and destroying confidence in Bitcoin.\n\n### Key Technical Details\n\n**Three-Phase Structure (all soft forks except Phase C)**\n\n- **Phase A** (triggered upon consensus activation, ~3 years after BIP-360): A soft fork invalidates new outputs to quantum-vulnerable address types (P2PK, P2PKH, P2WPKH, P2TR). Sending Bitcoin is only valid to P2QRH/P2MR-type outputs. Non-upgraded wallets can still send to P2QRH, but cannot receive at legacy addresses.\n\n- **Phase B** (~5 years after Phase A activation, i.e., ~8 years after BIP-360): A soft fork renders all ECDSA/Schnorr spends from quantum-vulnerable UTXOs invalid. Legacy UTXOs become permanently unspendable by classical means. Non-upgraded wallets lose all spending ability.\n\n- **Phase C (optional)** \u2014 Potentially a hard fork: Enables ZK proof of BIP-39 seed phrase possession to recover legacy coins even after Phase B. This is the most technically speculative component and would require further research into STARK/ZK systems. The [mailing list discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/uEaf4bj07rE) confirms Phase C would likely require a \"loosening of consensus rules\" \u2014 i.e., a hard fork.\n\n**Incentive Mechanism**: The proposal turns quantum security into a private incentive \u2014 failure to migrate by Phase B results in certain loss of funds, creating an economic deadline that overrides the usual upgrade inertia that plagues Bitcoin soft forks.\n\n### Community Reception\n\nReception was sharply divided. Supporters cited the need for certainty and coordination in the face of an existential threat. Critics raised four main objections as documented in the [mailing list thread](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/uEaf4bj07rE): (1) violation of Bitcoin's social contract (lost coins becoming permanently inaccessible violates the \"not your keys, not your coins\" principle); (2) the 25% problem (~5.25M BTC with exposed keys at risk of permanent lockout); (3) timeline uncertainty (the 5+ year deadline could easily slip to 7\u201310 years given Bitcoin's history); (4) the precedent of forced confiscation. The [BitcoinTalk forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5550298.0) noted that Phase B creates \"unprecedented coordination challenge\" and that the migration bottleneck could take 76\u2013568 days of continuous block processing even under ideal conditions.\n\n---\n\n## Draft BIP: Quantum-Resistant Transition Framework\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **BIP Number** | Unnumbered (Draft) |\n| **Title** | Quantum-Resistant Transition Framework for Bitcoin |\n| **Authors** | Not fully identified (submitted pseudonymously to bitcoindev) |\n| **Status** | Draft |\n| **Date** | August 2025 |\n| **URL** | [https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/2mQEyxHUskc](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/2mQEyxHUskc) |\n\n### Summary\n\nA separate framework proposal that appeared on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list in August 2025, proposing phased deprecation of ECDSA/Schnorr signatures and mandatory adoption of NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms. Similar in intent to Lopp's proposal but from a different author. Community responses noted that Google's then-current quantum processors lacked even 50 logical qubits, far short of the ~20 million noisy physical qubits required to break ECDSA (citing research that RSA-2048 would require approximately that many qubits). This proposal received less attention than the Lopp proposal.\n\n### Key Technical Details\n\nProposed complete replacement of ECDSA/Schnorr with NIST PQC-standardized algorithms (primarily ML-DSA / CRYSTALS-Dilithium) across all transaction types. Did not specify a phased timeline with the same granularity as Lopp's proposal.\n\n---\n\n## Related Draft Proposals (Unnumbered)\n\n### Draft: Quantum-Safe Address Format (2024)\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **BIP Number** | Draft (unnumbered) |\n| **Title** | Quantum-Safe Address Format |\n| **Status** | Draft (2024) |\n| **URL** | Referenced in [Bitcoin Optech quantum resistance topic](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/quantum-resistance/) |\n\nA 2024 draft proposing a new address format incorporating quantum-safe commitments. This preceded BIP-360 and appears to have been subsumed by the P2QRH/BIP-360 work.\n\n---\n\n### Draft: Destroying Quantum-Insecure Bitcoins (2025)\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **BIP Number** | Draft (unnumbered) |\n| **Title** | BIP for Destroying Quantum-Vulnerable Coins |\n| **Author** | Augustin Cruz |\n| **Status** | Draft (2025) |\n| **URL** | Referenced in [Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #385](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/12/19/) |\n\nAugustin Cruz proposed an approach to destroy quantum-vulnerable coins with certainty rather than allowing them to be swept by quantum attackers. This is the most extreme position on the \"vulnerable coins\" question and is highly controversial as it would constitute permanent, involuntary coin destruction.\n\n---\n\n### Draft: Pay-to-Taproot-Hash (P2TRH)\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **BIP Number** | Draft (unnumbered, in cryptoquick's BIP fork) |\n| **Title** | Pay to Taproot Hash (P2TRH) |\n| **Author** | Hunter Beast (cryptoquick) |\n| **Status** | Superseded by BIP-360 P2MR |\n| **URL** | [https://github.com/cryptoquick/bips/blob/p2trh/bip-p2trh.mediawiki](https://github.com/cryptoquick/bips/blob/p2trh/bip-p2trh.mediawiki) |\n\nAn earlier iteration of quantum-resistant addressing that proposed replacing Taproot's scriptPubKey tweaked X-only pubkey with `SHA256(SHA256(pubkey))`. This would hide the key until spend time (mitigating long-exposure attacks) while reusing all existing Taproot logic without new opcodes. The proposal was superseded by P2MR, which offers more flexibility by removing the keypath entirely rather than simply hashing it. As analyzed by [Project Eleven](https://blog.projecteleven.com/posts/a-look-at-post-quantum-proposals-for-bitcoin), P2TRH still leaves addresses vulnerable to \"just-in-time\" mempool attacks when spending.\n\n---\n\n### Quantum-Safe Taproot: Disable Key-Path Spending (2025)\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **BIP Number** | Draft (unnumbered) |\n| **Title** | Quantum-Safe Taproot via SLH-DSA Script Leaf |\n| **Author** | Discussed by Matt Corallo, others |\n| **Status** | Discussion stage |\n| **URL** | [https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/8O857bRSVV8](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/8O857bRSVV8) |\n\nA proposal to add an SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+) script leaf to existing Taproot Merkle trees. Wallets would create Taproot outputs with two spending paths: the existing Schnorr keypath for normal use, and a new OP_SLHDSA leaf as a quantum fallback. A subsequent soft fork would disable Schnorr key-path spends, forcing all spends through the SLH-DSA script path. Matt Corallo initiated this line of discussion on the mailing list in January 2025 per [Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #335](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/01/03/). Abdelhamid Bakhta later proposed native STARK verification as an alternative opcode, and developer Conduition proposed optimized SLH-DSA verification (~2,000 vbytes per input using OP_CAT-based Winternitz signatures \u2014 cheaper than OP_CAT-based Lamport signatures) per [Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #385](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/12/19/).\n\n---\n\n### Non-Interactive Transaction Compression (NTC) via STARKs (2025)\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **BIP Number** | Draft (unnumbered) |\n| **Title** | Non-Interactive Transaction Compression via STARKs |\n| **Author** | Ethan Heilman (primary proposer, co-author of BIP-360) |\n| **Status** | Discussion stage |\n| **URL** | [https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/wKizvPUfO7w](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/wKizvPUfO7w) |\n\nThis proposal addresses the scalability problem created by PQ signatures, which are 10\u2013100\u00d7 larger than Schnorr signatures. Rather than increasing block size or applying raw witness discounts (which risk \"inscription spam\"), NTC proposes that miners compress all PQ signatures in a block into a single STARK proof. A block-level STARK would verify that every transaction's PQ signatures are valid, reducing per-transaction signature overhead to approximately 2 bytes per input \u2014 enabling roughly 87 transactions/second (up from ~7 TPS), per the [Delving Bitcoin discussion](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/post-quantum-signatures-and-scaling-bitcoin-with-starks/1584). The proposal relies on PQ schemes supporting non-interactive aggregation (e.g., LaBRADOR). Tadge Dryja's separate proposal for cross-input signature aggregation (CISA) complements this, per [Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #385](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/12/19/).\n\n---\n\n### Commit/Reveal Proposals for UTXO Migration (2025)\n\nThree distinct commit/reveal schemes were proposed on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list in 2025, all sharing a core idea: allow UTXO owners to commit to a post-quantum recovery path today (before any consensus change), so that when quantum-vulnerable spends are eventually disabled, prepared holders can recover their coins. As summarized by [Project Eleven](https://blog.projecteleven.com/posts/a-look-at-post-quantum-proposals-for-bitcoin):\n\n1. **Quantum Security via Hashed Keys + Helper UTXOs** \u2014 URL: [groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/jr1QO95k6Uc](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/jr1QO95k6Uc). Pairs a hashed-key UTXO spend with a small PQ helper UTXO; commits the hash of a future PQ signature in a first transaction; reveals the matching PQ signature in a second transaction after confirmation. Prevents mempool key theft; requires pristine ECC key hygiene.\n\n2. **Pre-emptive Poison-Pill (Merkle commitment)** \u2014 URL: [groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/oa4nDmlLzN4](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/oa4nDmlLzN4). Pre-signs recovery transactions to PQ addresses; commits a Merkle root of transaction hashes in an `OP_RETURN` today (requires no consensus change). A future soft fork adds a delay on vulnerable spends, allowing recovery proof to override a quantum attacker's spend.\n\n3. **Fawkescoin Variant (Post-Quantum Guy Fawkes Protocol)** \u2014 URL: [groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/LpWOcXMcvk8](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/LpWOcXMcvk8). Commits `AID = h(pubkey)`, `SDP = h(pubkey || txid)`, and `CTXID = txid` in an `OP_RETURN`; a soft fork triggered by \"proof-of-quantum-computer\" (PoQC) enforces that any UTXO spend lacking a valid prior commitment is dropped.\n\n---\n\n## Relevant Related BIPs (Not Quantum-Specific but Directly Enabling)\n\n### BIP-54: Consensus Cleanup\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **BIP Number** | 54 |\n| **Title** | Consensus Cleanup |\n| **Authors** | Antoine Poinsot, Matt Corallo |\n| **Status** | Draft |\n| **URL** | [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0054.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0054.md) |\n\nBIP-54 is a consensus cleanup soft fork that fixes several long-standing protocol-level bugs: the timewarp attack, worst-case block validation time, and Merkle tree weaknesses (duplicate transactions in the coinbase). It is not a quantum-resistance proposal, but it is **strategically linked** to the PQ activation path: some developers (unattributed, as of February 2026) have argued BIP-54 should be activated first as a consensus-hardening prerequisite before pursuing BIP-360. Its clean, uncontroversial scope makes it a natural candidate for a \"warm-up\" soft fork that builds activation precedent.\n\n---\n\n### BIP-110: Reduced Data Temporary Softfork (RDTS)\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **BIP Number** | 110 (also known as BIP-444 / RDTS) |\n| **Title** | Reduced Data Temporary Softfork |\n| **Authors** | Luke Dashjr et al. |\n| **Status** | Draft (activation targeting Aug\u2013Sep 2026) |\n| **URL** | [https://bip110.org](https://bip110.org) |\n| **Node Support** | ~5% as of February 2026 ([tracking](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/services.html)) |\n| **Activation Block Heights** | Mandatory signaling at 961,632; max activation at 965,664 (est. Aug\u2013Sep 2026) |\n\nBIP-110 limits arbitrary data in Bitcoin transactions \u2014 restricting Taproot annexes, large control blocks, and witness elements to a maximum of 256 bytes per element \u2014 primarily as an anti-inscription measure. **However, this restriction is in direct tension with post-quantum cryptography.** NIST-standardized PQ signature sizes range from ~324 bytes (SHRINCS) to ~7,856 bytes (SLH-DSA-128s), all exceeding BIP-110's 256-byte witness element limit. If BIP-110 activates, it would make post-quantum signatures impossible under its rules until the restriction is lifted or expires (the soft fork is \"temporary\" but with no specified expiration date as of February 2026).\n\nThis conflict has created a notable strategic faction among developers (unattributed, as of February 2026) who argue the correct activation sequence is: **BIP-54 (consensus cleanup) \u2192 defeat BIP-110 (prevent PQ-blocking restrictions) \u2192 BIP-360 activation client (quantum resistance)**. The reasoning: BIP-110's witness size limits, while aimed at inscriptions, are collateral damage to the PQ migration path.\n\n---\n\n### BIP-347: OP_CAT\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **BIP Number** | 347 |\n| **Title** | OP_CAT |\n| **Authors** | Ethan Heilman, Armin Sabouri |\n| **Status** | Draft |\n| **URL** | [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0347.mediawiki](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0347.mediawiki) |\n\nOP_CAT is not a quantum-resistance BIP per se, but it enables Lamport signatures and Winternitz signatures within tapscript \u2014 providing a quantum-resistant signature check (at ~2,000 vbytes/input for Winternitz) as a near-term fallback. The [BIP-347 text](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0347.mediawiki) explicitly notes that with OP_CAT, users could mark taproot outputs as \"script-path only\" and embed Lamport signatures, but also cautions that OP_CAT alone cannot quantum-secure a taproot output without first disabling the key-path spend via a separate soft fork.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Library: libbitcoinpqc\n\nNot a BIP itself, but the primary implementation artifact supporting BIP-360. Available at [https://github.com/cryptoquick/libbitcoinpqc](https://github.com/cryptoquick/libbitcoinpqc), this C library with Rust, Python, and TypeScript bindings implements all three NIST-standardized PQC algorithms required by BIP-360's envisioned Phase 2 (ML-DSA-44, SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s, FN-DSA-512). All signatures are deterministic (no per-signature randomness), a requirement for Bitcoin's signing model.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Proposal | Status | Type | Key Innovation | Addresses Quantum Attack Type |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| BIP-360 (P2MR) | Draft (merged Feb 2026) | Soft fork | Removes Taproot keypath, Merkle-root-only output | Long-exposure |\n| Post-Quantum Migration Sunset | Draft (Jul 2025) | Soft fork series + optional hard fork | Phases out ECDSA/Schnorr with deadlines | Long + short (via future PQ sigs) |\n| Quantum-Resistant Transition Framework | Draft (Aug 2025) | Soft fork | Mandatory NIST PQ algorithm adoption | Long + short |\n| Quantum-Safe Taproot (OP_SLHDSA) | Discussion | Soft fork | PQ script leaf + keypath kill switch | Long + short |\n| P2TRH | Superseded | Soft fork | Hash the Taproot pubkey before committing | Long-exposure only |\n| NTC via STARKs | Discussion | New tx type | STARK-compress all PQ sigs per block | Scalability for PQ |\n| Commit/Reveal schemes (3 variants) | Discussion | Soft fork | Pre-commit to PQ recovery path today | Long + short (with PQ sigs) |\n| BIP-347 (OP_CAT) | Draft | Soft fork | Enables Lamport/Winternitz PQ sigs | Short (via script-path) |\n| BIP-54 (Consensus Cleanup) | Draft | Soft fork | Timewarp fix, validation cleanup | Enabling (activation precedent) |\n| BIP-110 (RDTS) | Draft (activation Aug\u2013Sep 2026) | Soft fork | 256B witness limit (anti-inscription) | **Potentially blocking PQ** |\n| QBIP (destroy vulnerable coins) | Discussion | Soft fork | Burn quantum-vulnerable UTXOs | Long-exposure prevention |\n\n---\n\n*Sources: [BIP-360 specification](https://bip360.org/bip360.html), [Bitcoin Magazine BIP-360 coverage](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/bitcoin-advances-toward-quantum-resistance), [Bitcoin-dev mailing list P2QRH thread](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/Aee8xKuIC2s), [Post-Quantum Migration Proposal](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/uEaf4bj07rE), [Project Eleven proposal analysis](https://blog.projecteleven.com/posts/a-look-at-post-quantum-proposals-for-bitcoin), [Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #385](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/12/19/), [Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #335](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/01/03/), [libbitcoinpqc](https://github.com/cryptoquick/libbitcoinpqc), [Chaincode Labs Bitcoin post-quantum paper](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf), [Forbes BIP-360 coverage](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/), [Delving Bitcoin NTC discussion](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/post-quantum-signatures-and-scaling-bitcoin-with-starks/1584), [BIP-54 spec](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0054.md), [BIP-110 / bip110.org](https://bip110.org), [BIP-110 node tracking](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/services.html)*\n",
  "03-proposals-and-bips/mailing-list-discussions": "# Bitcoin-Dev Mailing List: Quantum Resistance Discussions\n\n\n> **Last updated:** February 28, 2026 | **Confidence shelf-life:** 6 months (active discussions)\n\n\n*Compiled: February 2026 | Scope: Key threads from the Bitcoin Development Mailing List and Delving Bitcoin forum on quantum resistance, 2024\u20132026*\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nFrom 2018 to late 2024, quantum resistance was a peripheral topic on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, generating only occasional scattered messages. That changed dramatically in 2025. According to analysis published by [Willy Woo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/willy-woo-urges-bitcoin-holders-125433871.html) and reported by [MEXC](https://www.mexc.co/en-PH/news/552567), by June 2025 quantum-related messages comprised roughly 25% of all Bitcoin-dev mailing list traffic, rising to ~30% in July 2025 \u2014 a level never previously seen. The July 2025 Quantum Bitcoin Summit in San Francisco, hosted by Presidio Bitcoin, catalyzed this surge and formalized what had been fragmentary discussions into explicit, numbered BIP drafts. This document catalogs the major threads and their conclusions.\n\n---\n\n## Thread 1: Proposing a P2QRH BIP towards a quantum resistant soft fork\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **Subject** | Proposing a P2QRH BIP towards a quantum resistant soft fork |\n| **Date Range** | June 2024 \u2013 December 2024 (ongoing into 2025) |\n| **Primary Venue** | Bitcoin-dev mailing list + Delving Bitcoin cross-post |\n| **Key Participants** | Hunter Beast (cryptoquick), Antoine Riard, others |\n| **Mailing List URL** | [https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/Aee8xKuIC2s](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/Aee8xKuIC2s) |\n| **Delving Bitcoin URL** | [https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/proposing-a-p2qrh-bip-towards-a-quantum-resistant-soft-fork/956](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/proposing-a-p2qrh-bip-towards-a-quantum-resistant-soft-fork/956) |\n\n### Summary\n\nHunter Beast opened this thread in June 2024, cross-posting from the Bitcoin-dev mailing list to Delving Bitcoin to maximize visibility. The initial proposal was explicitly described as a \"rough draft\" seeking validation of approach \u2014 the first concrete BIP-level proposal to add quantum resistance to Bitcoin via a soft fork, framed as \"the first in a series of BIPs regarding a hypothetical 'QuBit' soft fork.\" The motivation given was that Bitcoin development and activation is slow, requiring early engagement even at an incomplete stage, per the [Delving Bitcoin post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/proposing-a-p2qrh-bip-towards-a-quantum-resistant-soft-fork/956).\n\nBy December 2024, the discussion had evolved substantially. The mailing list thread showed detailed technical exchanges particularly with Antoine Riard (Bitcoin contributor), who raised several specific concerns:\n\n### Key Arguments Made\n\n**For the P2QRH approach:**\n- Bitcoin's development velocity requires starting the conversation now, even if the threat is not imminent.\n- Concrete proposals \u2014 even imperfect ones \u2014 serve a valuable purpose in helping developers understand the solution space.\n- NIST has standardized three PQ algorithms (ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, FN-DSA) that have survived multiple rounds of cryptanalysis and can be targeted.\n- The BIP-341 taproot annex provides a natural vehicle for typed fields to carry PQ signatures and public keys, enabling a future witness discount (what Beast termed a \"quitness\" \u2014 a quantum witness discount).\n\n**Arguments and concerns raised:**\n\n1. **Algorithm selection complexity**: Antoine Riard noted that quantum computer capabilities vary by architecture (gate frequency, gate infidelity, cooling) and that Shor's algorithm performance is not architecture-independent. He argued the threat model needed to be more precisely defined before committing to specific algorithms.\n\n2. **Verification performance**: Riard expressed concern about verification cost, particularly for FALCON (FN-DSA), whose quaternion-based mathematics may be difficult for commodity CPUs. He suggested each signature scheme should have its own BIP (similar to how BIP-340/341 are separated), stating \"I think it could be interesting to split the BIP in multiple ones.\"\n\n3. **Witness discount concerns**: On Beast's proposal for a 4\u00d7 \"QuBit witness discount,\" Riard warned against assuming SSD technology cost curves would remain linear. He cited BIP-103's bandwidth predictions as a cautionary example of over-optimism. A 16\u00d7 discount proposed for FALCON signatures was \"far too much for the community to accept\" per Beast's own assessment.\n\n4. **Satoshi's Shield**: The thread discussed Beast's \"Satoshi's Shield\" concept \u2014 the game-theoretic argument that Bitcoin coin scarcity (requiring burning energy/fees to acquire) makes quantum attacks economically constrained. Riard distinguished this from an alternative \"fee jail\" defense: designing scripts that require burning large amounts of satoshis as a spending precondition, making quantum attacks uneconomical even without protocol upgrades.\n\n5. **NIST security level**: Beast updated the BIP to default to NIST Security Level V (256-bit security) after discussion, providing the highest available post-quantum security.\n\n### Conclusions Reached\n\nNo firm technical consensus was reached, but the discussion validated that: (a) a soft fork pathway exists for adding PQ signatures; (b) the annex is the most natural vehicle for this data; (c) the witness discount mechanism is critical to maintaining Bitcoin's transaction throughput; and (d) the BIP should be split into a framework BIP and per-algorithm BIPs.\n\n---\n\n## Thread 2: Quantum Computer Upgrade Path (January 2025)\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **Subject** | Quantum computer upgrade path |\n| **Date Range** | January 2025 |\n| **Primary Venue** | Bitcoin-dev mailing list |\n| **Key Participants** | Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr, Tadge Dryja |\n| **URL** | Referenced in [Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #335](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/01/03/) |\n\n### Summary\n\nMatt Corallo opened a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list proposing to add a **quantum-resistant signature-checking opcode** (specifically `OP_SPHINCS` or equivalent) in tapscript. The goal was to allow funds to remain spendable even if ECDSA and Schnorr signature operations were disabled due to quantum forgery risk. This thread was the first focused discussion by influential Core contributors on a concrete technical mechanism for post-quantum Bitcoin in 2025.\n\n### Notable Arguments\n\n**Matt Corallo**: Proposed adding a dedicated PQ signature opcode to tapscript as an `OP_SUCCESSx` replacement. Wallets would begin adding PQ script-paths to their Taproot outputs as soon as the specification was finalized. This \"commit now, activate later\" approach allows preparation without waiting for soft fork activation. Per [Chaincode Labs](https://forklog.com/en/chaincode-labs-sizes-up-the-quantum-threat-to-bitcoin/), Corallo specifically proposed `OP_SPHINCS` to verify post-quantum signatures, enabling wallets to create Taproot outputs with both a normal Schnorr key-path and a quantum-safe SLH-DSA script-path.\n\n**Luke Dashjr**: Noted that a soft fork is unnecessary *immediately* as long as there is \"widespread agreement now about how quantum-resistant signature-checking opcode would work in the future.\" Users only need to commit to it as an option that *may* become available later, meaning wallets could begin implementation without waiting for activation.\n\n**Tadge Dryja**: Proposed a \"**transitory soft fork**\" mechanism \u2014 a temporary restriction on quantum-insecure ECDSA and Schnorr signatures that would activate if quantum computers appeared to be on the verge of stealing funds. The transitory soft fork would become permanent only if someone fulfilled an on-chain puzzle solvable only with a quantum computer (or via discovery of a fundamental cryptographic vulnerability); otherwise it could be renewed or allowed to lapse, restoring spendability of ECDSA-protected coins. Per [Bitcoin Optech #335](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/01/03/), this was characterized as a \"kill switch\" with a reversibility provision.\n\n### Conclusions Reached\n\nThe thread established that: (a) Bitcoin Core contributors view the addition of PQ opcodes as technically feasible via soft fork; (b) the \"commit now, activate opcode later\" model allows wallet preparation without network consensus urgency; (c) a transitory soft fork with a quantum-triggered permanent activation is one possible emergency mechanism.\n\n---\n\n## Thread 3: A Post-Quantum Migration Proposal (July\u2013September 2025)\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **Subject** | A Post Quantum Migration Proposal |\n| **Date Range** | July 12 \u2013 September 2025 (multiple updates) |\n| **Primary Venue** | Bitcoin-dev mailing list |\n| **Key Participants** | Jameson Lopp (Casa), Christian Papathanasiou, Boris Nagaev (Lightning Labs), Conduition (independent developer), others |\n| **URL** | [https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/uEaf4bj07rE](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/uEaf4bj07rE) |\n\n### Summary\n\nJameson Lopp introduced this three-phase migration proposal \u2014 arguably the most ambitious and controversial Bitcoin protocol proposal in years \u2014 building on his earlier essay \"Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin.\" Presented at the July 2025 Quantum Bitcoin Summit in San Francisco, the proposal received immediate and extensive discussion per [Christine D. Kim's newsletter](https://christinedkim.substack.com/p/issue-01). The Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #365 ([August 1, 2025](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/08/01/)) characterized it as \"a three-step proposal for phasing out spending from quantum-vulnerable outputs,\" noting that \"consensus is forming on the need for a strategy, at the very least.\"\n\nThe proposal's core innovation is turning quantum security into a private economic incentive: rather than hoping users voluntarily migrate, it imposes a credible deadline after which failure to migrate means permanent loss of access to funds.\n\n### Key Arguments Made\n\n**For the proposal (Lopp, Papathanasiou, et al.):**\n- Any Bitcoin holding quantum-vulnerable public keys (~25% of supply) is vulnerable to theft by the first actor to develop a CRQC. Without a migration mechanism, Bitcoin faces a \"redistribution dilemma\" favoring whoever achieves quantum supremacy first.\n- \"Quantum recovered coins only make everyone else's coins worth less. Think of it as a theft from everyone\" \u2014 paraphrasing Satoshi's \"lost coins\" maxim in reverse.\n- Historical Bitcoin upgrades take many years; beginning migration planning now is the only credible defense.\n- Phase A (prohibiting new quantum-vulnerable outputs) can be implemented as a soft fork that is minimally disruptive while creating ecosystem pressure to adopt quantum-resistant addresses.\n- The SLH-DSA hash-based scheme in BIP-360's Phase 2 provides a security-maximizing option since cryptographic hashes are among the most conservative security assumptions in all of cryptography.\n\n**Against the proposal:**\n\n1. **Violation of Bitcoin's social contract**: Multiple respondents argued that forcing coins into a new format violates Bitcoin's foundational property-rights model. Unlike Taproot (which was purely opt-in), this proposal imposes consequences on users who don't act. Respondents in the [BitcoinTalk thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5550298.0) argued it \"fundamentally changes Bitcoin's value proposition.\"\n\n2. **The 25% problem**: With ~5.25 million BTC having exposed public keys, forcing these to become unspendable could constitute massive economic disruption. Many may be genuinely lost coins, long-term cold storage, or inheritance situations.\n\n3. **Timeline risk**: The 5-year timeline (3 years post-BIP-360 + 2 years) \"assumes smooth consensus and implementation \u2014 given Bitcoin's history, this could easily stretch to 7\u201310 years, most likely pushing implementation past the 2027\u20132030 quantum timeline,\" per the mailing list.\n\n4. **Crypto-agility concern**: Even PQ schemes may have undiscovered flaws. Committing to a specific scheme via mandatory migration adds protocol rigidity. \"We have no certainty that novel flaws won't be found.\"\n\n5. **Phase C hard fork risk**: The optional recovery mechanism via ZK proof of BIP-39 seed knowledge would require a hard fork, undermining the claim that the whole proposal is a soft fork series.\n\n**Technical refinements proposed:**\n\n- **Boris Nagaev (Lightning Labs)**: Proposed temporarily locking coins at Phase B rather than permanently destroying them, setting a future block height X at which EC spending would become possible again (if Phase C isn't ready). This \"temporary freeze\" approach gives more time for ZK proof development.\n\n- **Conduition**: Raised the question of whether the temporary lock logic should also apply to Phase A, and what happens if sending to pre-quantum addresses is locked in permanently without Phase C readiness.\n\n- **R-value commitment approach**: One respondent proposed that in current consensus, OP_CHECKSIG's R-value can be freely picked by the signer, meaning it could be forced to commit to a valid PQ signature in a future soft fork \u2014 providing a path to hybrid signing without changing address types.\n\n### Conclusions Reached\n\nThe discussion revealed that broad consensus exists on the *need* for a migration strategy but not on its *form*. Key unresolved questions as of late 2025: (1) How to handle legacy non-HD wallets (burn vs. allow quantum theft vs. \"liberate\"); (2) How to make the protocol \"crypto-agile\" so specific algorithm choices aren't permanently locked in; (3) Whether Phase C (ZK recovery) is technically achievable within any reasonable timeframe.\n\n---\n\n## Thread 4: Bitcoin-dev Quantum Discussions \u2014 Developer Positions (2025\u20132026)\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **Subject** | Various \u2014 developer positions on quantum risk |\n| **Date Range** | February 2025 \u2013 February 2026 |\n| **Primary Sources** | Mailing list, X (formerly Twitter), interviews |\n| **URL** | Multiple \u2014 see citations below |\n\n### Summary\n\nA notable meta-analysis emerged in early 2026 regarding the positions of Bitcoin's most influential Core developers. Per a detailed analysis by [FuTu News](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/69055174/in-the-face-of-quantum-threats-bitcoin-core-developers-have-chosen-to-ignore-it) and [WEEX](https://www.weex.com/news/detail/in-the-face-of-the-quantum-threat-bitcoin-core-developers-have-chosen-to-ignore-it-346468), the overall picture is that most influential Bitcoin developers do not consider quantum risk urgent enough to act on today \u2014 a stance that creates a governance challenge for any BIP seeking activation.\n\n### Developer Positions (Documented Statements)\n\n**Pieter Wuille** (February 2025, mailing list): \"I certainly agree that there is no urgency at present; however, if (and only if) quantum computers capable of breaking cryptography become a reality, the entire ecosystem will have no choice but to disable compromised spending schemes, and this must be done before such machines emerge.\" Wuille has participated in quantum discussions but characterizes the current risk as theoretical. He co-authored SegWit and Taproot \u2014 Bitcoin's only two major protocol upgrades in the last decade.\n\n**Jonas Nick** (Blockstream Research): Described as the sole exception among influential Core developers who takes quantum risk seriously. Participated in publishing \"Hash-based Signature Schemes for Bitcoin\" with Tim Ruffing and Mikhail Kudinov in Q4 2025, per [Blockstream's quarterly update](https://blog.blockstream.com/blockstream-quarterly-update-q4-2025/).\n\n**Tim Ruffing** (Blockstream Research, July 2025): Published \"The Post-Quantum Security of Bitcoin's Taproot as a Commitment Scheme,\" demonstrating that Taproot's script-path commitment mechanism remains secure against quantum manipulation \u2014 a key theoretical result showing that funds committed to PQ public keys in Taproot's hidden script paths are safe even if Schnorr and ECDSA are broken. Has not directly commented on urgency of the threat per [Murmurations II](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-developers-are-sleepwalking).\n\n**Ethan Heilman** (co-author of BIP-360, February 2025): \"I firmly believe that Bitcoin must transition to post-quantum signatures in the near future.\" One of the most vocal advocates for the post-quantum transition, co-authored OP_CAT (BIP-347) and proposed NTC via STARKs.\n\n**Adam Back** (Blockstream CEO, November 2025): Characterized the threat as 20\u201340 years away, stating Bitcoin can counter quantum threats \"through soft-forks\" via NIST's SLH-DSA when needed, per [Phemex](https://phemex.com/news/article/adam-back-bitcoin-can-counter-quantum-threats-with-softforks-39152). Explicitly denied urgency.\n\n**Peter Todd**: Explicitly denied the feasibility or practical relevance of near-term quantum threats.\n\n**Jameson Lopp** (Casa, July 2025): \"We aim to protect the value of the UTXO set and minimize the incentives for quantum attacks. Bitcoin has never before faced an existential threat to its cryptographic primitives. A successful quantum attack would bring severe economic disruption and chaos to the entire ecosystem.\"\n\n**Luke Dashjr**: Noted that a soft fork is not yet necessary but that widespread consensus on a PQ opcode specification can begin now.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThe dominant position among Bitcoin's most technically influential developers (Wuille, Back, Todd, etc.) is that quantum risk is real in principle but not imminent in practice. The most active advocates for faster action (Heilman, Beast, Lopp, Nick) are mid-tier contributors in terms of merge influence. Without buy-in from top-tier maintainers, any BIP faces significant activation headwinds. The practical implication, per [FuTu News](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/69055174/), is that \"without their approval, any upgrade to Bitcoin will fail.\"\n\n---\n\n## Thread 5: Hash-Based Signature Schemes for Bitcoin (Q4 2025)\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **Subject** | Hash-based signature schemes and their adaptation for Bitcoin |\n| **Date Range** | Q4 2025 |\n| **Primary Venue** | Paper publication + Bitcoin-dev discussion |\n| **Key Participants** | Tim Ruffing, Jonas Nick, Mikhail Kudinov (all Blockstream Research) |\n| **URL** | Referenced in [Blockstream Q4 2025 update](https://blog.blockstream.com/blockstream-quarterly-update-q4-2025/) and [Bitcoin Optech #385](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/12/19/) |\n\n### Summary\n\nThe Blockstream Research cryptography team published a paper providing an overview of hash-based signature schemes (Winternitz OTS, XMSS, SPHINCS+/SLH-DSA, SHRINCS) and their adaptation to Bitcoin's specific requirements. This work is significant as it came from Blockstream researchers who have historically been cautious about quantum urgency, suggesting a shift toward concrete preparatory work.\n\nThe paper was preceded by Tim Ruffing's earlier work \"Post-Quantum Security of Bitcoin's Taproot as a Commitment Mechanism,\" which proved that a quantum attacker has no alternative way to open a Taproot commitment \u2014 establishing Taproot's script-path as a quantum-secure vehicle for PQ public key storage. These two papers together provide the theoretical foundation for the \"commit PQ key in Taproot script-path today, activate PQ opcode later\" upgrade strategy.\n\n### Key Technical Points\n\n- Hash-based signatures have the most conservative security assumptions in all of post-quantum cryptography \u2014 their security reduces only to the security of the underlying hash function (SHA-256), making them arguably the most trustworthy long-term option.\n- SHRINCS (a variant discussed in the paper) offers 324-byte stateful signatures \u2014 significantly smaller than SPHINCS+/SLH-DSA (7,856 bytes) but requires state management.\n- The paper examines compatibility of these schemes with Bitcoin-specific features: HD wallet derivation paths, multisig constructions, threshold signatures, and silent payments. Per [Bitcoin Optech #385](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/12/19/), Jesse Posner's concurrent research indicated that \"hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets, silent payments, key aggregation, and threshold signatures could be compatible with some of the commonly referenced quantum-resistant signature algorithms.\"\n\n---\n\n## Thread 6: Quantum Computing Report and Vulnerable Coins Discussion (October\u2013November 2025)\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **Subject** | Quantum computing threat to Bitcoin \u2014 report and coin destruction debate |\n| **Date Range** | October\u2013November 2025 |\n| **Key Sources** | Human Rights Foundation report, Chaincode Labs paper, Jameson Lopp essay |\n| **URLs** | [HRF report](https://hrf.org/latest/the-quantum-threat-to-bitcoin/), [Chaincode Labs paper](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) |\n\n### Summary\n\nTwo major research publications in late 2025 elevated the mailing list discussion:\n\n1. The **Human Rights Foundation report** (October 2025), based on six months of expert discussions at the Presidio Bitcoin Quantum Summit, quantified vulnerabilities at approximately 6.7 million BTC at risk and outlined a two-track strategy: short-term contingency measures (approximately 2 years) and a long-term comprehensive path (approximately 7 years).\n\n2. The **Chaincode Labs paper** (October 2025), authored by Tim Ruffing, Jonas Nick, and others, provided a systematic analysis confirming that ~6.26 million BTC (~$650 billion at time of writing) could be at risk from a sufficiently advanced CRQC. The paper recommended the dual-track approach and highlighted that \"several leading cryptographers and Bitcoin developers \u2014 such as Tim Ruffing, Jonas Nick, and Ethan Heilman \u2014 are actively working on Bitcoin's quantum readiness,\" per [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf).\n\n### Key Debates\n\n**Should quantum-vulnerable coins be destroyed?** The mailing list saw intense debate on whether Bitcoin should implement a mechanism to burn coins in addresses where public keys are permanently exposed (P2PK, reused addresses). Lopp framed allowing quantum theft as analogous to \"vampires feeding upon the system.\" Critics argued any coin destruction (or even freezing) is a form of confiscation that violates Bitcoin's core property rights model. Paolo Ardino (Tether CEO) suggested quantum theft might be preferable to coercive coin freezing per [CryptoRank](https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/f25f5-bitcoin-quantum-resistance-freeze-vulnerable-addresses).\n\n**Taproot migration urgency**: Willy Woo issued public guidance urging Bitcoin holders to migrate from Taproot addresses to older formats that hide public keys behind hashes, prompting Jonas Schnelli to warn that \"the moment you broadcast a spend, your pubkey hits the mempool\" \u2014 highlighting that no currently-deployed address type provides short-exposure quantum resistance, per [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/willy-woo-urges-bitcoin-holders-125433871.html).\n\n---\n\n## Summary: State of Mailing List Consensus as of February 2026\n\n| Topic | Consensus Level | Status |\n|---|---|---|\n| Quantum threat is real in principle | High | Acknowledged by nearly all participants |\n| Threat is imminent (< 5 years) | Low | Most influential devs say 20\u201340 years |\n| BIP-360 (P2MR) as first step | Moderate | Merged into BIP repo; no activation commitment |\n| Migration deadline (Lopp proposal) | Low | Controversial; many \"NACK\" responses |\n| PQ opcode in tapscript | Moderate | Matt Corallo proposal well-received by Core contributors |\n| Which PQ algorithm to use | Low | Still debated: lattice (ML-DSA) vs. hash-based (SLH-DSA) |\n| Block size or witness discount change | Low | Highly contested; risk of reopening block size wars |\n| Emergency mechanism if CRQC arrives | Low-moderate | Transitory soft fork discussed but no specification |\n| Freeze recovery methods | Emerging | BitMEX Research proposed four recovery schemes (Feb 2026); no BIP yet |\n\n---\n\n## Thread 7: BitMEX Research \u2014 Quantum Freeze Recovery Proposals (July 2025 \u2013 February 2026)\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **Subject** | Three-part series on Bitcoin quantum preparedness, culminating in freeze recovery methods |\n| **Date Range** | July 21, 2025 \u2013 February 8, 2026 |\n| **Primary Venue** | BitMEX Blog |\n| **Key Participants** | BitMEX Research (uncredited individual author) |\n| **URLs** | [Part 1](https://www.bitmex.com/blog/quantum-safe-lamport-signatures), [Part 2](https://www.bitmex.com/blog/Taproot-Quantum-Spend-Paths), [Part 3](https://www.bitmex.com/blog/Mitigating-The-Impact-Of-The-Quantum-Freeze) |\n\n### Summary\n\nBitMEX Research published a three-part series building from basic hash-based signature education to a detailed freeze mitigation framework. While not a mailing list thread, the series represents a substantive technical contribution to the freeze recovery debate that intersects directly with the Lopp migration proposal (Thread 3) and Corallo's OP_SPHINCS approach (Thread 2).\n\n**Part 1** (July 2025) argued that hash-based signature schemes \u2014 relying only on SHA-256 \u2014 should be preferred over lattice-based alternatives for Bitcoin, because they add no new cryptographic assumptions. Using Lamport signatures as an illustrative case, the article noted that modern hash-based schemes like SPHINCS+ can achieve signature sizes as small as ~2KB with customizable parameter tradeoffs (citing Olaoluwa Osuntokun's Presidio Bitcoin Quantum Summit presentation). BitMEX proposed an adoption-by-value strategy: large holders (ETFs, treasury companies) adopt quantum-safe outputs first, since per-transaction cost is negligible for entities holding thousands of BTC. Individual users could keep savings in quantum-safe outputs while using quantum-vulnerable P2WPKH (with no address reuse) for day-to-day spending.\n\n**Part 2** (January 2026) proposed a \"quantum Taproot\" output type: a new Taproot version with the key-path spend disabled (matching BIP-360's approach), containing two tapleaf spend paths \u2014 one quantum-safe, one quantum-vulnerable. This allows users to upgrade wallets immediately while continuing to use efficient classical signatures until QDay. The article explicitly endorsed BIP-360. A freeze timing analysis identified three conflicting pressures that make choosing a freeze date difficult:\n\n| Factor | Impact on Freeze Date |\n|---|---|\n| Freeze is controversial \u2192 needs to be close to QDay for consensus | Later |\n| Need large gap between freeze activation and freeze enforcement for user preparation | Later |\n| Need safety margin before expected QDay | Earlier |\n\nAn illustrative timeline showed ~9 years from freeze soft-fork lock-in to expected QDay (5-year ban on sends to vulnerable addresses + 2-year spend ban + 2-year safety buffer).\n\n**Part 3** (February 2026) proposed four recovery methods for coins that would otherwise be permanently frozen:\n\n1. **Commitment Recovery Method**: Two transactions \u2014 a setup transaction containing a hash commitment in OP_Return, followed after 100 confirmations by a recovery transaction that includes the private key, destination address, and setup TXID in OP_Return. Proves ownership before the quantum-vulnerable signature goes on-chain. Limitations: one-time use only per address; vulnerable to miner censorship (funds stolen if recovery tx not confirmed within 100 blocks); requires no prior address reuse.\n\n2. **Seed Phrase Commitment Method**: Same two-transaction pattern, but reveals the ordered BIP-39 seed phrase + derivation path rather than the private key. The critical insight: BIP-39's word-to-seed derivation uses PBKDF2 with SHA-512, which is quantum-safe. Therefore, while a quantum computer can go from public key \u2192 private key, it cannot go from private key \u2192 seed phrase. This method works even when the public key is already exposed (reused addresses, Taproot outputs).\n\n3. **Pre-QDay Commitment Method**: The setup transaction goes on-chain before QDay. Useful for Satoshi's coins \u2014 the owner can commit before QDay while maintaining plausible deniability (the commitment looks like a normal OP_Return output). A single 256-bit Merkle root commitment can cover thousands of UTXOs, reducing on-chain congestion.\n\n4. **ZKP Seed Phrase Method**: Uses a STARK-based zero-knowledge proof to prove knowledge of the seed phrase without revealing it. Advantages: reusable (unlike commitment methods), requires no advance preparation, and preserves privacy. This is the most powerful recovery option \u2014 Bitcoiners need not prepare before QDay; they simply upgrade wallets post-freeze to include the ZKP output. The article notes STARK proofs are quantum-secure, unlike many other ZKP schemes.\n\nBitMEX concluded that combining multiple recovery methods could make \"almost every quasi frozen coin potentially recoverable.\" Only coins where (a) no seed phrase was used AND (b) the public key was exposed at creation (P2PK without pre-QDay commitment) would be truly unrecoverable.\n\n### Key Data Point\n\nThe series included a comprehensive UTXO distribution table sourced from [Dune Analytics / murchandamus](https://dune.com/murchandamus/bitcoins-utxo-set), mapping each output type to applicable recovery methods:\n\n| Output Type | BTC | Supply % | Recovery Methods |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| P2WPKH | 8,011,484 | 40.1% | Commitment, Seed Phrase, ZKP |\n| P2PKH | 4,709,800 | 23.6% | Commitment, Seed Phrase, ZKP |\n| P2SH | 4,045,377 | 20.3% | Commitment, Seed Phrase, ZKP |\n| P2WSH | 1,296,835 | 6.5% | Commitment, Seed Phrase, ZKP |\n| P2PK | 1,716,419 | 8.6% | Pre-QDay Commitment only |\n| Taproot | 196,292 | 1.0% | Seed Phrase, ZKP |\n| New quantum safe output | 0 | 0.0% | None required |\n| **Total** | **19,976,207** | **100.0%** | |\n\n### Relevance to Other Threads\n\nThe BitMEX recovery proposals directly address the \"Phase C\" gap in Lopp's three-phase migration (Thread 3), which called for a ZK-proof recovery mechanism but left implementation unspecified. The Seed Phrase Commitment and ZKP methods are concrete instantiations of what Lopp's Phase C would look like. The Pre-QDay Commitment method offers a novel path for Satoshi's coins that neither the \"burn\" nor \"allow theft\" camps had previously articulated.\n\n---\n\n## The BIP-54 / BIP-110 / BIP-360 Activation Sequence (February 2026)\n\nAs of late February 2026, a strategic discussion has emerged among some Bitcoin developers (unattributed) regarding the optimal activation sequence for quantum resistance. The proposed path:\n\n1. **Activate BIP-54 (Consensus Cleanup)** \u2014 a non-controversial soft fork by Antoine Poinsot and Matt Corallo that fixes the timewarp attack, worst-case validation time, and Merkle tree weaknesses. BIP-54 serves as a \"warm-up\" activation that builds soft-fork precedent and consensus-hardening without touching quantum-specific logic. Full spec: [BIP-54](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0054.md).\n\n2. **Defeat BIP-110 (RDTS)** \u2014 BIP-110 (Luke Dashjr et al.) aims to restrict arbitrary data in Bitcoin transactions by capping witness elements at 256 bytes, primarily targeting inscriptions. It is targeting activation around August\u2013September 2026 via mandatory signaling (block heights 961,632\u2013965,664), with approximately 5% node support as of February 2026 per [BIP-110 tracking](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/services.html). The problem for PQ: **every NIST-standardized post-quantum signature exceeds 256 bytes** (SHRINCS ~324B, FN-DSA ~666B, ML-DSA 2,420B, SLH-DSA 7,856B). If BIP-110 activates, it would block the PQ migration path until its restrictions are lifted or expire. The \"defeat\" framing reflects the view that BIP-110's anti-inscription intent, while defensible on its own terms, creates unacceptable collateral damage to Bitcoin's quantum preparedness.\n\n3. **Release a BIP-360 activation client** \u2014 with BIP-54 activated (proving the community can soft fork) and BIP-110 defeated (preserving witness space for PQ signatures), release a client that activates BIP-360's P2MR output type and begins the post-quantum migration.\n\nThis three-step strategy has not been publicly attributed to specific individuals or published in a formal proposal. It represents an emerging activist position that treats PQ readiness as an argument against BIP-110, adds a governance dimension to what was previously framed as a purely anti-inscription debate, and implicitly prioritizes BIP-360 over other PQ proposals.\n\n### Relevance to Other Threads\n\nThe BIP-110/PQ tension connects directly to Thread 6 (the Bitcoin Core policy debate) and the broader governance bottleneck identified by the [JBBA paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) and [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf). It also surfaces a new fault line in the developer community: the anti-inscription camp (represented by BIP-110 proponents) versus the PQ-readiness camp, whose goals may be incompatible if both require changes to witness data handling.\n\n---\n\n*Sources: [Bitcoin-dev P2QRH thread](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/Aee8xKuIC2s), [Post-Quantum Migration thread](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/uEaf4bj07rE), [Bitcoin Optech #335](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/01/03/), [Bitcoin Optech #385](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/12/19/), [Bitcoin Optech #365](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/08/01/), [Delving Bitcoin P2QRH](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/proposing-a-p2qrh-bip-towards-a-quantum-resistant-soft-fork/956), [Christine D.

  "03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork": "# Upgrade Path Analysis: Soft Fork vs. Hard Fork for Quantum Resistance\n\n\n> **Last updated:** February 28, 2026 | **Confidence shelf-life:** 1 year (governance dynamics shift slowly)\n\n\n*Compiled: February 2026 | Cross-references: `../04-signature-schemes/comparison-matrix.md`, `../01-threat-model/`*\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nAdding post-quantum (PQ) cryptographic signatures to Bitcoin is not merely a technical challenge \u2014 it is a governance and economic challenge that requires navigating Bitcoin's conservative upgrade culture, enormous block-space constraints from large PQ signatures, and deeply contentious questions about whether to freeze, burn, or simply leave vulnerable billions of dollars in legacy coins. This document analyzes the upgrade path options systematically, drawing on the full body of proposals and discussions as of early 2026.\n\nThe core tension is that Bitcoin's most fundamental security assumptions \u2014 the intractability of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) underpinning ECDSA and Schnorr signatures \u2014 are vulnerable to Shor's algorithm on a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC). As established in `../01-threat-model/`, approximately 6.26\u20136.9 million BTC are currently held in addresses where public keys have been permanently exposed on-chain, including all P2PK outputs, all Taproot outputs (which embed a tweaked pubkey in their scriptPubKey), and all addresses that have been spent from at least once. Per the [Chaincode Labs paper](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf), this represents a systemic risk that no single upgrade can fully resolve.\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: Soft Fork Approaches\n\n### What is a Soft Fork?\n\nA soft fork tightens consensus rules \u2014 transactions valid under old rules can be made invalid under new rules, but old nodes remain able to follow the chain. In practice, soft forks treat new output types as \"anyone-can-spend\" from the perspective of legacy nodes (the SegWit model), while upgraded nodes enforce the new spending conditions.\n\n### How PQ Signatures Can Be Added via Soft Fork\n\nThere are four primary soft fork mechanisms for adding PQ signatures, all of which have been proposed in 2024\u20132025:\n\n#### Mechanism 1: New SegWit Version (BIP-360 P2MR)\n\nBIP-360 defines a SegWit v2 output type (`OP_2 <32-byte-merkle-root>`, addresses starting `bc1z`). Legacy nodes see this as anyone-can-spend. Upgraded nodes enforce that spends must satisfy the Merkle-committed script tree. Crucially, this output type **removes the Taproot keypath spend** \u2014 the primary long-exposure vulnerability \u2014 while retaining full tapscript functionality via `OP_SUCCESSx` opcodes, which enable future PQ signature opcodes to be added in subsequent soft forks. Per the [BIP-360 specification](https://bip360.org/bip360.html), any quantum-resistant signature-checking opcode added to tapscript can be combined with BIP-360 to fully quantum-harden Bitcoin outputs.\n\nThis approach uses the same model as P2TR's deployment: a new SegWit version is defined, wallets begin creating P2MR addresses, and the UTXO set gradually shifts as users migrate. No block size changes are required for Phase 1.\n\n**Soft fork constraints for BIP-360:**\n- The P2MR output is 37 bytes larger per input than a P2TR keypath spend (103 bytes vs. 66 bytes) due to the required control block, per the [BIP specification](https://bip360.org/bip360.html). This is a modest cost.\n- Phase 1 (P2MR output type alone) provides long-exposure protection but **not** short-exposure protection \u2014 a CRQC could still steal coins during the ~10-minute mempool window.\n- Full protection requires a Phase 2 soft fork adding PQ signature opcodes (see Mechanism 2 below).\n\n#### Mechanism 2: New PQ Signature Opcode in Tapscript\n\nA soft fork can add `OP_SUCCESSx`-based opcodes to tapscript that verify PQ signatures. Matt Corallo proposed `OP_SPHINCS` on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list in January 2025 per [Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #335](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/01/03/). Abdelhamid Bakhta later proposed native STARK verification as an alternative. Conduition proposed optimized SLH-DSA verification using OP_CAT-based Winternitz one-time signatures (~2,000 vbytes/input), per [Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #385](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/12/19/).\n\nThe key advantage of opcode-based PQ signatures over a new output type is that they can be used **inside existing Taproot outputs** (P2TR or P2MR) as script-path spending conditions. This means:\n1. Wallets can *today* add a PQ script leaf to their Taproot outputs, committing to a PQ public key hash that has no effect until the opcode is activated.\n2. When the opcode is soft-fork activated, those pre-committed script leaves become valid spending conditions.\n3. If ECDSA/Schnorr are subsequently disabled, the PQ script path is the only available fallback.\n\nTim Ruffing's paper \"The Post-Quantum Security of Bitcoin's Taproot as a Commitment Scheme\" proved that this commitment approach is quantum-secure: a quantum attacker cannot forge a different commitment to the Taproot Merkle root, per [Blockstream's Q4 2025 update](https://blog.blockstream.com/blockstream-quarterly-update-q4-2025/).\n\n**Soft fork constraints for PQ opcodes:**\n- PQ signatures are 10\u2013100\u00d7 larger than Schnorr signatures. As documented in `../04-signature-schemes/comparison-matrix.md`, ML-DSA-44 signatures are 2,420 bytes vs. 64 bytes for Schnorr \u2014 a 38\u00d7 increase. SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s signatures are 7,856 bytes \u2014 a 123\u00d7 increase.\n- Without a witness discount adjustment, most blocks would fit only a handful of PQ-signed transactions, effectively breaking Bitcoin's transaction throughput.\n- With the existing 75% SegWit witness discount (1 WU per byte for witness data), PQ signatures are still prohibitively large. Hunter Beast's original proposal included a 4\u00d7 additional \"QuBit witness discount\" (bringing PQ witness data to ~0.0625 WU per byte), per the [Delving Bitcoin P2QRH thread](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/proposing-a-p2qrh-bip-towards-a-quantum-resistant-soft-fork/956). This would increase chain state growth from ~100 GB/year to potentially 200\u2013300 GB/year.\n- A 16\u00d7 discount (needed for FALCON signatures) was deemed \"far too much for the community to accept\" by the proposal's own author. Any significant increase in the witness discount risks reopening the contentious block size debate.\n- As an alternative to a witness discount increase, Ethan Heilman proposed Non-Interactive Transaction Compression (NTC) via STARKs \u2014 compressing all PQ signatures in a block into a single block-level STARK proof, reducing per-transaction overhead to approximately 2 bytes per input, per the [Delving Bitcoin NTC discussion](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/post-quantum-signatures-and-scaling-bitcoin-with-starks/1584). This could theoretically enable ~87 transactions/second (vs. Bitcoin's current ~7 TPS), but requires new transaction types and unproven STARK integration.\n\n#### Mechanism 3: OP_CAT + Lamport/Winternitz Signatures (BIP-347)\n\nReactivating the disabled OP_CAT opcode (BIP-347) enables PQ-resistant Lamport or Winternitz signatures entirely within existing tapscript \u2014 without any new PQ-specific opcodes. Conduition demonstrated that OP_CAT-based Winternitz signatures cost ~2,000 vbytes per input, cheaper than the previously proposed Lamport approach, per [Bitcoin Optech #385](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/12/19/).\n\n**Critical constraint**: Even with OP_CAT, Taproot outputs cannot be made fully quantum-safe without also disabling the keypath spend. The [BIP-347 specification](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0347.mediawiki) explicitly states: \"The use of Lamport Signatures in taproot outputs is unlikely to be quantum resistant even if the script spend-path is made quantum resistant. This is because taproot outputs can also be spent with a key. An attacker with a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could bypass the taproot script spend-path by finding the discrete log of the taproot output and thus spending the output using the key spend-path.\" This is precisely why BIP-360's P2MR output type \u2014 which structurally removes the keypath \u2014 is required as a foundation before OP_CAT-based PQ signatures can be quantum-secure.\n\n#### Mechanism 4: Commitment-Scheme Approach (Taproot Hidden Paths)\n\nA \"commit now, protect later\" soft fork approach was validated by Tim Ruffing's 2025 research. The sequence:\n1. **No consensus change needed today**: Users add a PQ public key hash as a hidden script leaf in their Taproot outputs. No soft fork required.\n2. **Soft fork 1**: Add a PQ signature verification opcode to tapscript.\n3. **Soft fork 2** (if/when CRQC is imminent): Disable Schnorr keypath spends. All existing P2TR outputs with a pre-committed PQ leaf remain spendable via the PQ script path; those without are frozen.\n\nPer [Bitcoin Magazine's technical analysis](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-quantum-risk-is-real-one-solution-might-start-with-taproot), this approach is the most gradualist and least disruptive: it preserves normal Schnorr spending today while providing a pre-committed quantum fallback that only activates when needed. The main risk is that users who did not pre-commit a PQ leaf will have their Taproot outputs frozen at the point Schnorr is disabled.\n\n### The \"Kill Switch\" Soft Fork\n\nTadge Dryja's proposal for a **transitory soft fork** adds a notable variant: a soft fork that temporarily restricts quantum-insecure signatures, with a mechanism for permanent or temporary activation based on demonstrated quantum capability. Per [Bitcoin Optech #335](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/01/03/), if anyone fulfills an on-chain puzzle contract solvable only with a quantum computer, the transitory restriction automatically becomes permanent. If not triggered, the restriction lapses. This provides a \"proof-of-quantum-computer\" (PoQC) trigger that avoids premature permanent action.\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Hard Fork Approaches\n\n### What Would Require a Hard Fork?\n\nA hard fork relaxes consensus rules \u2014 transactions that were previously invalid become valid. In Bitcoin's context, the relevant hard fork scenarios are:\n\n1. **Block size increase**: Increasing Bitcoin's maximum block size/weight to accommodate larger PQ signatures without a witness discount. BTQ Technologies' \"Bitcoin Quantum Core Release 0.2\" demonstrated this approach, using a 64 MiB block size (vs. the current ~4 MB weight limit) to accommodate ML-DSA signatures, per [The Quantum Insider](https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/10/16/btq-technologies-announces-quantum-safe-bitcoin-using-nist-standardized-post-quantum-cryptography/). This would be a hard fork incompatible with all existing Bitcoin nodes and clients.\n\n2. **Phase C of the Post-Quantum Migration Proposal**: Jameson Lopp's Phase C \u2014 allowing quantum-vulnerable UTXOs to be recovered via ZK proof of BIP-39 seed phrase possession \u2014 would \"likely require a loosening of consensus rules (a hard fork)\" per the [mailing list discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/uEaf4bj07rE). This is because spending from addresses that have been disabled under Phase B requires re-enabling previously invalid spending paths.\n\n3. **NUMS-point Taproot keypath disabling**: The existing approach of using \"Nothing Up My Sleeve\" (NUMS) points to disable Taproot's keypath does **not** actually prevent quantum attacks \u2014 a quantum attacker could still find the discrete log of any NUMS point. Genuinely disabling the keypath in an already-deployed P2TR output set would require changing the interpretation of existing outputs \u2014 a hard fork.\n\n### Why Hard Forks Are Controversial in Bitcoin\n\nHard forks are deeply controversial in Bitcoin for several reasons:\n\n1. **Network split risk**: Unlike Ethereum's hard forks (which have institutional coordination), Bitcoin has no recognized central authority. Any hard fork creates the risk of a permanent chain split (as occurred with Bitcoin Cash in 2017). The two chains would share all historical UTXOs but diverge from the fork point.\n\n2. **Miner coordination requirement**: All mining pools representing >50% of hashrate must coordinate to activate the new chain, creating a coordination game with enormous economic stakes.\n\n3. **No emergency precedent**: Bitcoin has never executed a contentious hard fork for security reasons. The closest precedent \u2014 the 2013 chain fork \u2014 was resolved within hours and was an unintentional bug, not a deliberate rule change.\n\n4. **Philosophical opposition**: Many Bitcoin contributors view hard forks as categorically different from soft forks \u2014 a \"social contract\" violation. Per [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-quantum-risk-is-real-one-solution-might-start-with-taproot), \"Hard choices, big trade-offs\" dominate this discussion.\n\n5. **The hybrid paper warning**: A 2025 academic paper in the Journal of the British Blockchain Association warned that convincing decentralized communities to accept \"50% capacity loss and 2\u20133\u00d7 fee increases could take 10\u201315 years, if achievable at all,\" per the [JBBA hybrid paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321). PQ migration is \"a purely defensive measure imposing only costs,\" unlike SegWit which offered fee reductions.\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: SegWit's Role in PQ Signature Adoption\n\nSegWit (implemented via BIP-141 in 2017) is the primary technical enabler for PQ signatures in Bitcoin, for two reasons:\n\n### The Witness Discount Mechanism\n\nSegWit established the weight unit (WU) system: non-witness data costs 4 WU/byte, witness data costs 1 WU/byte \u2014 a 75% effective discount. This discount exists because witness data is separated from the transaction ID (TXID), preventing third-party malleability and reducing the \"economic weight\" of signatures relative to outputs. For PQ signatures, this existing discount partially \u2014 but not fully \u2014 ameliorates the size problem:\n\n- A 2,420-byte ML-DSA signature at 1 WU/byte = 2,420 WU vs. a 64-byte Schnorr signature at 256 WU (64 \u00d7 4). Even discounted, ML-DSA is ~9.5\u00d7 the WU cost of Schnorr.\n- A 7,856-byte SLH-DSA signature at 1 WU/byte = 7,856 WU vs. 256 WU for Schnorr \u2014 a 31\u00d7 cost increase.\n\nTo maintain Bitcoin's current ~7 TPS throughput, PQ signatures would need an additional 4\u00d7 (for ML-DSA) or 16\u00d7 (for SLH-DSA) witness discount beyond the existing SegWit discount, per Hunter Beast's analysis in the [P2QRH mailing list thread](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/Aee8xKuIC2s). These discounts introduce the risk of cheaper-than-payments data storage (the \"inscription spam\" problem). A soft fork can modify the witness discount \u2014 it was introduced as a soft fork in 2017 \u2014 but changing it again would be contentious.\n\n### SegWit as the Deployment Template\n\nSegWit's deployment model (treating new output types as anyone-can-spend to legacy nodes) is the exact template being used for BIP-360's P2MR and any future PQ output types. The progression P2WPKH \u2192 P2WSH \u2192 P2TR \u2192 P2MR follows the same technical pattern, with each version adding capability. This means PQ signatures can be added without disrupting existing outputs \u2014 a critical property for avoiding the chain-split risk of a hard fork.\n\n---\n\n## Part 4: Taproot's Role \u2014 Help or Hindrance?\n\nTaproot (BIP-341, activated November 2021) has a complex relationship with quantum resistance:\n\n### Ways Taproot Helps\n\n1. **Script-path commitment vehicle**: Taproot's Merkle tree structure allows a PQ public key to be committed as a hidden script leaf today, before any consensus change. Tim Ruffing proved this commitment is quantum-secure per [Blockstream's Q4 2025 update](https://blog.blockstream.com/blockstream-quarterly-update-q4-2025/). This is the foundation of the \"commit now, activate later\" strategy.\n\n2. **OP_SUCCESSx opcode upgrade path**: Tapscript's `OP_SUCCESSx` opcodes allow new signature verification opcodes to be added via soft fork, making Taproot's script system extensible to PQ algorithms.\n\n3. **Foundation for P2MR**: BIP-360's P2MR is structurally derived from P2TR and reuses all of Tapscript's infrastructure. P2WSH (the pre-Taproot alternative) does not support `OP_SUCCESSx` and therefore cannot host PQ opcodes, making Taproot's presence essential for the soft-fork upgrade path.\n\n### Ways Taproot Hurts\n\n1. **Keypath exposes pubkey**: The most significant quantum vulnerability in Taproot is the keypath spend, which embeds a tweaked X-only public key directly in the scriptPubKey. This key is visible on-chain from the moment the output is created \u2014 unlike P2PKH, which hides the key until first spend. According to [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf), Taproot outputs constituted ~32.5% of all UTXOs but only ~0.74% of Bitcoin's total value as of early 2025 \u2014 but their use in Lightning Network and Layer-2 protocols means this percentage will grow significantly.\n\n2. **NUMS-point Taproot keypath disabling is quantum-vulnerable**: Current \"script-path only\" Taproot outputs use a NUMS point (a provably unspendable keypath derived from a hash) to signal script-path-only intent. As noted in [BIP-347's discussion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0347.mediawiki), this does **not** defeat quantum attacks: a CRQC could still compute the discrete log of any NUMS point. True quantum security requires P2MR (which removes the keypath entirely at the protocol level).\n\n3. **Protocol prominence increases migration scope**: Taproot is foundational to Lightning Network channels, BitVM, Ark, and other Layer-2 protocols, per [BIP-360's motivation section](https://bip360.org/bip360.html). This means quantum-vulnerable Taproot outputs will be created at very high rate going forward, making the migration problem larger with each passing year.\n\n---\n\n## Part 5: Backward Compatibility Considerations\n\n### Legacy UTXOs\n\nThe core backward compatibility problem is that approximately 25% of all Bitcoin (~6.26\u20136.9 million BTC) already resides in quantum-vulnerable outputs, per the [Chaincode Labs paper](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf). No soft fork can retroactively change the script conditions of existing outputs \u2014 this would require a hard fork. The options for legacy UTXOs under a soft fork regime are:\n\n| Approach | Mechanism | Consequence |\n|---|---|---|\n| Allow voluntary migration | New PQ output type available | No enforcement; most vulnerable UTXOs remain |\n| Prohibit new vulnerable outputs (Phase A) | Soft fork invalidates new P2PK, P2PKH, P2TR outputs | Stops accumulating vulnerable UTXOs; doesn't fix existing ones |\n| Freeze vulnerable UTXOs (Phase B) | Soft fork makes legacy ECDSA spends invalid | ~25% of BTC becomes unspendable |\n| ZK recovery mechanism (Phase C) | Hard fork enables BIP-39 proof recovery | Allows recovery of frozen coins; contentious |\n| Allow quantum theft | No action | Stolen by first entity with CRQC |\n| Burn/destroy | Soft fork sends dormant coins to unspendable address | Permanent supply reduction |\n\n### Non-Upgraded Nodes\n\nUnder BIP-360's soft fork model, non-upgraded nodes treat P2MR outputs as anyone-can-spend (standard SegWit behavior). They would enforce neither the P2MR script path rules nor any future PQ signature opcodes. This means:\n- Non-upgraded nodes remain valid chain participants but cannot fully validate PQ transactions.\n- A miner running a non-upgraded node could theoretically mine an invalid PQ spend; other nodes would reject the block.\n- The security model degrades gracefully: non-upgraded nodes trust that upgraded nodes are validating correctly.\n\nPer [Project Eleven's analysis](https://blog.projecteleven.com/posts/a-look-at-post-quantum-proposals-for-bitcoin), \"Bitcoin's adaptable UTXO architecture\" is a significant advantage over Ethereum and Solana, where smart contracts permanently embed ECDSA signature checks at the contract level.\n\n---\n\n## Part 6: Emergency vs. Planned Migration Scenarios\n\n### Planned Migration (The Gradual Path)\n\nThe [Chaincode Labs paper](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) recommends a dual-track strategy:\n- **Short-term (2 years)**: Deploy a minimally viable PQ output type (BIP-360 Phase 1, i.e., P2MR) and at least one PQ signature opcode as a contingency measure deployable on short notice.\n- **Long-term (7 years)**: Design and deploy an optimal quantum-resistant protocol with thoroughly tested algorithms, witness discount changes, and STARK-based compression.\n\nThe planned migration assumes 3 years for BIP finalization, code review, and community consensus; 6 months for activation; and several additional years for wallets, custodians, exchanges, and enterprise software to upgrade, per [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/).\n\n### Emergency Migration (The Crisis Path)\n\nIf a CRQC arrives before migration is complete, the realistic scenario is:\n\n1. **Short-exposure attacks begin**: A CRQC operator begins attacking transactions in the mempool, deriving private keys from temporarily exposed public keys and broadcasting double-spend transactions with higher fees.\n2. **Emergency soft fork proposal**: Developers fast-track a soft fork to disable Schnorr and ECDSA spending. Without a pre-committed PQ script path, all existing UTXOs become frozen.\n3. **Mass panic and fee spike**: Even with BIP-360 deployed, the 76\u2013568 days of UTXO migration time (per the [Chaincode Labs paper](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf)) means many users would be racing to migrate before the freeze deadline, causing massive fee spikes.\n4. **Governance crisis**: The decision of what to do with un-migrated coins \u2014 freeze, burn, or allow theft \u2014 would need to be made under extreme time pressure.\n\nTadge Dryja's \"transitory soft fork\" mechanism provides the cleanest emergency pathway: a pre-specified, narrow rule change that temporarily disables vulnerable spending and can be triggered by on-chain proof of quantum capability per [Bitcoin Optech #335](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/01/03/).\n\n### The Commitment Scheme Intermediate Case\n\nThe commit/reveal proposals (see `bip-catalog.md`) offer a middle path between planned and emergency migration. Users who pre-commit their recovery transactions today are protected regardless of when quantum arrives \u2014 their coins can only be spent via the committed PQ path even after ECDSA/Schnorr are disabled. This is the most practical near-term individual protection measure available without any protocol change.\n\n---\n\n## Part 7: Conclusions and Recommendations\n\n### Feasibility of Soft Fork Approach\n\nA complete quantum-resistance upgrade **is achievable via soft forks** \u2014 no hard fork is technically required for the core protection (assuming Phase C recovery is not pursued). The required soft fork sequence is:\n\n1. **Soft Fork 1 (BIP-360 P2MR)**: Deploy quantum-resistant output type. Low risk, already merged into BIP repo. Provides long-exposure protection.\n2. **Soft Fork 2 (PQ opcode)**: Add `OP_SLHDSA`, `OP_MLDSA`, or equivalent to tapscript. Requires algorithm selection consensus. Provides short-exposure protection when combined with P2MR.\n3. **Soft Fork 3 (witness discount)**: Optionally increase the witness discount to maintain throughput. Contested but not unprecedented.\n4. **Soft Fork 4 (legacy spend sunset)**: Disable ECDSA/Schnorr from quantum-vulnerable UTXOs after migration deadline. Extremely controversial; governance challenge.\n\n### The Fundamental Trade-off\n\nBitcoin faces what the [JBBA hybrid paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321) calls a \"defensive downgrade\": a migration that imposes immediate, certain costs (50\u201370% throughput reduction, 2\u20133\u00d7 fee increases) with no immediate benefit (the quantum threat may not materialize for decades). Historical precedent \u2014 Bitcoin's contentious block size wars \u2014 suggests achieving consensus for a purely costly change may take 10\u201315 years. The community's only reliable levers are:\n\n1. **Economic incentives**: Making PQ output types cheaper than vulnerable ones (the SegWit playbook).\n2. **Graduated timelines**: Giving the ecosystem years of notice before any enforcement, as in Lopp's proposal.\n3. **Technical elegance**: Ensuring PQ integration is minimally invasive (BIP-360's philosophy \u2014 \"prepared, not scared\").\n4. **NTC via STARKs**: If block-level STARK compression can be deployed alongside PQ signatures, the throughput cost disappears \u2014 but this adds significant implementation complexity.\n\nThe [Human Rights Foundation](https://hrf.org/latest/the-quantum-threat-to-bitcoin/) summarizes the challenge: \"Any successful soft fork integrating quantum-resistant signature schemes will necessitate user education, thoughtful user interface design, and coordination across a global ecosystem that includes users, developers, hardware manufacturers, node operators, and civil society. For Bitcoin to remain a reliable tool for human rights and financial freedom in the quantum era, its upgrades must be inclusive, accessible, and resilient.\"\n\n---\n\n*Sources: [BIP-360 specification](https://bip360.org/bip360.html), [Chaincode Labs paper](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf), [Bitcoin Optech #335](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/01/03/), [Bitcoin Optech #385](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/12/19/), [Project Eleven analysis](https://blog.projecteleven.com/posts/a-look-at-post-quantum-proposals-for-bitcoin), [Post-Quantum Migration thread](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/uEaf4bj07rE), [Blockstream Q4 2025](https://blog.blockstream.com/blockstream-quarterly-update-q4-2025/), [HRF report](https://hrf.org/latest/the-quantum-threat-to-bitcoin/), [JBBA hybrid PQ paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf), [Delving Bitcoin NTC](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/post-quantum-signatures-and-scaling-bitcoin-with-starks/1584), [BIP-347 OP_CAT](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0347.mediawiki), [Forbes BIP-360](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/), [Bitcoin Optech #365](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/08/01/), [Bitcoin Magazine witness discount](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/glossary/witness-discount)*\n",

Analysis\n\n### 2.1 Which Schemes Are Most Viable for Bitcoin?\n\nBased on research through early 2026, three NIST-standardized schemes have emerged as the primary candidates for Bitcoin integration via BIP-360:\n\n**FN-DSA-512 (FALCON-512) \u2014 Best for size**: At ~666 bytes per signature and 897 bytes for the public key, FALCON offers by far the smallest footprint among lattice-based schemes. The combined 1,563 bytes is roughly 16\u00d7 ECDSA, which is large but plausibly manageable with witness discounting. The critical problem is implementation complexity: Gaussian sampling over NTRU lattices requires floating-point arithmetic, causing 6\u20138\u00d7 performance variation depending on hardware FPU availability, creating side-channel risks in consensus-critical code. [JBBA hybrid paper (Dec 2025)](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf)\n\n**ML-DSA-44 (Dilithium Level 2) \u2014 Best for simplicity**: At 2,420 bytes signature + 1,312 bytes public key = 3,732 combined (~38\u00d7 ECDSA), this is NIST's primary general-purpose recommendation. The [BIP-360 analysis](https://bip360.org) notes this produces a 38\u00d7 size increase in transactions. Verification is very fast (purely integer arithmetic, no floating-point). The [libbitcoinpqc library](https://github.com/cryptoquick/libbitcoinpqc) implements ML-DSA-44 as the Dilithium option for BIP-360.\n\n**SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s \u2014 Most conservative security**: The smallest SLH-DSA parameter set still produces 7,856-byte signatures. The key advantage is the purely hash-based security assumption \u2014 if all lattice problems were somehow compromised, SLH-DSA would remain secure. [Matt Corallo has proposed OP_SPHINCS](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/719/) to embed SPHINCS+ in Taproot leaves as a quantum fallback with zero current cost.\n\n**SHRINCS \u2014 Emerging research option**: A December 2025 proposal by Jonas Nick (Blockstream) on [Delving Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/shrincs-324-byte-stateful-post-quantum-signatures-with-static-backups/2158) offers ~324-byte signatures for the first spend from a key \u2014 11\u00d7 smaller than ML-DSA-44 \u2014 by combining SPHINCS+ (stateless fallback) with unbalanced XMSS (efficient stateful primary). This remains research-stage.\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 The Fundamental Tradeoff: Size vs. Security Assumptions\n\nThe post-quantum signature landscape presents a three-way tradeoff:\n\n1. **Hash-only assumptions** (SLH-DSA, XMSS, LMS, SHRINCS): Most conservative cryptographic assumptions \u2014 security reduces entirely to hash preimage resistance, which has decades of analysis. Cost: large signatures (7 KB\u201350 KB for SLH-DSA). \n\n2. **Lattice assumptions** (ML-DSA, FN-DSA): Compact signatures (666 bytes\u20134.6 KB), fast verification. Assumption: hardness of Module-LWE/SIS (ML-DSA) or NTRU lattice problems (FN-DSA). These assumptions are well-studied but are younger than hash security \u2014 no classical or quantum algorithm is known to break them efficiently, but the field is only ~25 years old. [NIST FIPS 204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final)\n\n3. **Isogeny assumptions** (SQIsign): Extremely compact (65 bytes PK + 148 bytes sig at Level 1), but very slow and based on the endomorphism ring problem \u2014 a relatively new mathematical structure that was shaken by the 2022 SIKE break (a different isogeny problem, but caution remains). [SQIsign specification](https://sqisign.org/spec/sqisign-20250205.pdf)\n\nMatt Corallo articulated the conservative Bitcoin developer view in [February 2026](https://cryptobriefing.com/matt-corallo-most-crypto-wallets-are-quantum-safe-bitcoins-soft-fork-could-require-proof-of-seed-phrase-ownership-and-the-ethereum-foundation-is-leading-in-quantum-threat-response-unchained/): \"post-quantum schemes are still fairly young\" \u2014 suggesting hash-based schemes offer a safer initial commitment while lattice schemes mature.\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 Why Hash-Based Schemes Have Unique Appeal\n\nHash-based signatures (SPHINCS+, XMSS, LMS, Lamport, WOTS+) derive their security solely from the collision resistance and preimage resistance of their underlying hash function \u2014 properties that have survived decades of cryptanalysis and are believed to be resistant to both classical and quantum attacks (with at most a quadratic speedup for Grover's algorithm, addressed by doubling output length).\n\nThis makes them uniquely trustworthy: the [NIST SP 800-208 rationale](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/stateful-hash-based-signatures) explicitly notes that \"no quantum computing algorithms are known that would pose a practical threat in the foreseeable future\" to hash-based security. In the context of Bitcoin \u2014 a system where cryptographic failures could be catastrophic and irreversible \u2014 this matters enormously. A lattice problem might be broken by an unexpected mathematical breakthrough; a well-studied hash function is much less likely to fall.\n\nThe Bitcoin-specific argument for hash-based schemes: using SLH-DSA now commits Bitcoin only to SHA-256 security (which Bitcoin already depends on for block hashing), avoiding any new cryptographic assumptions. [BIP-360 co-author Ethan Heilman argued](https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/CAJowKgL+YMWSgEPcVF-u8bNvPFK35cY-3cHtimWD2mtXdDhUzQ@mail.gmail.com) that adopting SLH-DSA first would \"buy time for non-hash-based PQ signature schemes to mature.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2.4 The Statefulness Problem with XMSS and LMS\n\nStateful hash-based schemes (XMSS, LMS, HSS) require tracking which one-time keys have been used. Each key pair can sign only a fixed maximum number of messages (e.g., 2^10 = 1,024 for XMSS with h=10). If the same OTS key is used twice, the private key is partially revealed and the scheme becomes insecure.\n\nThis creates acute problems for Bitcoin:\n- **Hardware wallets** may be restored from seed phrases, losing state information\n- **Backup restoration** always resets the counter, potentially causing key reuse\n- **Hot wallets** that have signed many transactions may run out of slots\n\n[NIST SP 800-208](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-208.pdf) requires stateful hash-based signatures to be \"implemented in hardware cryptographic modules that do not allow secret keying material to be exported\" \u2014 essentially prohibiting them from standard software wallets. SHRINCS (described above) represents a 2025 research attempt to bridge this gap by using stateless SPHINCS+ as a fallback.\n\n---\n\n### 2.5 Aggregation Possibilities\n\n**Native aggregation**: Unlike BLS signatures (used in Ethereum), none of the NIST-standardized PQ schemes support native non-interactive signature aggregation. This is a significant disadvantage \u2014 aggregation allows many signatures to be combined into one, dramatically reducing block space usage.\n\n**STARK-based compression**: Ethan Heilman (BIP-360 co-author) has proposed aggregating post-quantum signatures into a single STARK proof at the block level \u2014 effectively compressing thousands of signatures into a compact proof. The [LinkedIn summary of BIP-360 context](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-dinarian-262a46239_bitcoin-may-take-7-years-to-upgrade-to-post-quantum-activity-7431056197459374080-QSnT) notes that \"Ethereum's post-quantum team has a working prototype using hash-based ZK STARKs to aggregate signatures for each block into a single proof.\" This is the \"NTC via STARKs\" concept from the Phase 1 context.\n\n**Batch verification**: ML-DSA does support batch verification (verifying multiple signatures together is faster than doing them individually), offering a modest improvement but not the radical compression achievable with aggregation.\n\n**BTQ's Falcon aggregation**: BTQ Technologies has [reported pioneering](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/btq-technologies-demonstrates-quantum-safe-bitcoin-using-nist-standardized-post-quantum-cryptography-protecting-2-trillion-market-at-risk-302585981.html) NIST-standardized FALCON signature aggregation techniques, suggesting this may be possible with FN-DSA as well.\n\n---\n\n### 2.6 STARK-Based Compression\n\nThe most ambitious size-reduction strategy involves wrapping post-quantum signatures in STARK proofs. Rather than placing full PQ signatures on-chain, transactions could include a STARK proof of signature validity \u2014 compressing an entire block's worth of PQ signatures into a single compact proof. The [JBBA hybrid analysis](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) estimates \"10\u00d7 compression possible\" but notes it remains \"concept only, no prototypes\" with a 5\u20137 year R&D timeline.\n\nFor Bitcoin specifically, this approach would require significant consensus changes and has philosophical tensions with Bitcoin's simplicity ethos, but it represents the long-term path to maintaining acceptable throughput while using PQ signatures.\n\n---\n\n*Cross-references: See [../03-proposals-and-bips/bip-catalog.md](../03-proposals-and-bips/bip-catalog.md) for BIP-360 details.

Based on CRYSTALS-Dilithium, developed by Ducas, Kiltz, Lepoint, Lyubashevsky, Schwabe, Seiler, Stehl\u00e9.*\n\n---\n\n## 1. How ML-DSA Works\n\nML-DSA (Module-Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm) is a **lattice-based signature scheme** derived from CRYSTALS-Dilithium. Its security rests on the hardness of two problems over module lattices: the **Module Learning With Errors (MLWE)** problem and the **Module Short Integer Solution (MSIS)** problem. These are generalizations of LWE (Learning With Errors) \u2014 structured lattice problems that are believed to be hard for both classical and quantum computers.\n\n### 1.1 Fiat-Shamir with Aborts\n\nML-DSA uses the **Fiat-Shamir with aborts** paradigm to construct an efficient signature:\n\n1. **Key generation**: Generate a public matrix **A** (derived from a hash of a seed) and secret vectors **s\u2081**, **s\u2082** with small coefficients. The public key is `(seed, t) = (seed, As\u2081 + s\u2082)`. The private key is `(seed, s\u2081, s\u2082, t)`.\n\n2. **Signing**: \n   - Sample a random masking vector **y** with bounded coefficients\n   - Compute **w = Ay** and derive a challenge hash `c = H(\u03bc, w\u2081)` where **w\u2081** are the high-order bits of **w** and `\u03bc` is a hash of the message and public key\n   - Compute response `z = y + cs\u2081`\n   - **Abort** if `z` leaks information about the secret key (if coefficients are too large), and restart with new **y**\n   - Output signature `(c, z, hint)`\n\n3. **Verification**: Reconstruct **w'** from `z`, `c`, the public key, and the hint. Verify that `c = H(\u03bc, w'\u2081)` and that `z` has small coefficients.\n\nThe \"with aborts\" mechanism is crucial: by restarting whenever the response would leak secret information, ML-DSA achieves security without relying on floating-point arithmetic or Gaussian sampling. This makes it much easier to implement securely and deterministically than FALCON. [NIST FIPS 204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final)\n\n### 1.2 Why \"Module\" Lattices?\n\nStandard LWE signatures have large sizes. Module-LWE uses structured matrices over polynomial rings, allowing much smaller keys and signatures while retaining provable security. The module structure provides a tunable security/size tradeoff: the parameter `k` (module rank) can be varied to hit different security levels. [Encryption Consulting: ML-DSA Overview (May 2025)](https://www.encryptionconsulting.com/ml-dsa-and-pq-signing/)\n\n---\n\n## 2. NIST Standardization: FIPS 204\n\nCRYSTALS-Dilithium was selected by NIST in July 2022 as the **primary post-quantum signature standard**, then finalized as **FIPS 204** on August 13, 2024 \u2014 the same date as FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA). NIST explicitly designated ML-DSA as its \"primary recommendation for general use\" among PQ signature schemes. [NIST announcement: \"NIST Releases First 3 Finalized Post-Quantum Encryption Standards\" (Aug 2024)](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards)\n\nNote: FIPS 204 specifies **ML-DSA**, which is technically distinct from CRYSTALS-Dilithium \u2014 the two are not directly compatible at the implementation level. The FIPS version incorporates minor modifications. Per [RFC 9882 (Oct 2025)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9882.html), \"ML-DSA and Dilithium are not compatible.\"\n\n---\n\n## 3. All Parameter Sets with Sizes\n\nML-DSA has three parameter sets corresponding to NIST security levels 2, 3, and 5:\n\n| Parameter Set | NIST Level | PK (bytes) | SK (bytes) | Signature (bytes) | Combined PK+Sig | vs ECDSA combined |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| ML-DSA-44 | Level 2 (~128-bit PQ) | 1,312 | 2,560 | 2,420 | 3,732 | ~38\u00d7 |\n| ML-DSA-65 | Level 3 (~192-bit PQ) | 1,952 | 4,032 | 3,309 | 5,261 | ~54\u00d7 |\n| ML-DSA-87 | Level 5 (~256-bit PQ) | 2,592 | 4,896 | 4,627 | 7,219 | ~74\u00d7 |\n\n*Sources: [libbitcoinpqc / BIP-360 reference library](https://github.com/cryptoquick/libbitcoinpqc); [wolfSSL PQC documentation](https://www.wolfssl.com/documentation/manuals/wolfssl/appendix07.html); [Encryption Consulting ML-DSA overview](https://www.encryptionconsulting.com/ml-dsa-and-pq-signing/)*\n\nFor comparison, FN-DSA-512 (FALCON) has a 897-byte public key and ~666-byte signature \u2014 roughly 4\u20135\u00d7 smaller than ML-DSA-44 in combined size.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Pros: Compact Signatures, Fast Verification, Simple Implementation\n\n**Relatively compact for a PQ scheme**: ML-DSA-44's 2,420-byte signature is ~38\u00d7 ECDSA but far smaller than SLH-DSA-128s (7,856 bytes). In the PQ landscape, this represents a reasonable middle ground.\n\n**Very fast verification**: ML-DSA verification uses only integer arithmetic over polynomial rings \u2014 no floating-point, no Gaussian sampling. Verification speed is roughly 5\u20136\u00d7 slower than ECDSA but far faster than SLH-DSA. The [JBBA hybrid paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) cites ~696,000 verification cycles for ML-DSA-87 (vs ~80,000 for ECDSA).\n\n**Straightforward implementation**: No floating-point arithmetic or complex statistical sampling is required. This substantially reduces implementation complexity and side-channel risk compared to FALCON. [PostQuantum.com PQC overview](https://postquantum.com/post-quantum/hybrid-cryptography-pqc/)\n\n**Broad HSM support**: By February 2025, HSMs from Securosys and others already supported all three NIST-standardized algorithms. BIP-360 author Hunter Beast explicitly cited this as a reason to restrict BIP-360 to NIST-approved algorithms: \"HSMs such as those provided by Securosys already have support for all three algorithms, which is essential for secure deployment of federated L2 treasuries.\" [Bitcoin Dev Mailing List: P2QRH / BIP-360 Update (Feb 2025)](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/9d6f01ca-9fab-4638-b59b-64db6301c2dbn@googlegroups.com/T/)\n\n**FIPS compliance**: FIPS 204 enables institutional use in regulated environments where NIST standards are mandated. This matters for exchanges, ETF custodians, and enterprise Bitcoin users.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Cons: Larger Than ECDSA, Younger Security Assumption, Large Public Keys\n\n**Still much larger than ECDSA**: Even ML-DSA-44 produces signatures 38\u00d7 larger than ECDSA. The [LinkedIn analysis by Garima Singh (Jan 2026)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/post-quantum-migration-blockchain-existential-threat-garima-singh-x9gof) calculated that Bitcoin's 1MB blocks would collapse from ~7,600 ECDSA transactions to ~400 with ML-DSA-65 \u2014 a 95% throughput reduction.\n\n**Large public keys inflate the UTXO set**: ML-DSA-65's 1,952-byte public key vs ECDSA's 33 bytes represents a 59\u00d7 increase in per-UTXO storage. The [JBBA paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) estimates this would expand the Bitcoin UTXO set from ~5 GB to ~296 GB if fully migrated \u2014 a massive permanent node storage increase.\n\n**Lattice assumption less battle-tested than hash**: Module-LWE has been studied intensively since ~2009 and was strengthened through the NIST process, but it is far younger than SHA-256 (2001) and the broader hash function security tradition. A mathematical breakthrough \u2014 while unlikely \u2014 could potentially undermine all lattice-based schemes simultaneously. This is why NIST standardized both ML-DSA and SLH-DSA: to provide a non-lattice backup.\n\n**BIP-32 incompatibility**: [Bitcoin developer 'conduition' identified on the bitcoin-dev mailing list](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/9d6f01ca-9fab-4638-b59b-64db6301c2dbn@googlegroups.com/T/) that ML-DSA has BIP-32 compatibility issues affecting xpub generation in watch-only wallets. The mathematical structure of module lattices does not support hierarchical deterministic (HD) key derivation in the same way as secp256k1. This is an open engineering problem for Bitcoin wallet integration.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bitcoin-Specific Analysis\n\n### 6.1 Block Space and Throughput Impact\n\nThe quantitative impact of ML-DSA on Bitcoin has been studied extensively. Measured on permissioned blockchain implementations (Hyperledger Fabric), the [JBBA hybrid paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) found:\n\n| Metric | Current (ECDSA) | With ML-DSA-65 | Impact |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Average transaction size | 250 bytes | 2,800 bytes | 11.2\u00d7 increase |\n| Transactions per MB | 4,000 | 357 | \u221291% |\n| Block capacity (3,000 tx/block) | 3,000 tx | 268 tx | \u221291% throughput |\n| Verification time | 0.5 ms/tx | 2.8 ms/tx | 5.6\u00d7 slower |\n\nNote: these figures are for permissioned systems; Bitcoin's fully permissionless, globally distributed verification would likely face additional performance degradation.\n\nThe MEXC analysis of [post-quantum signature bloat (Jan 2026)](https://www.mexc.co/en-PH/news/569194) calculated that an ML-DSA-44 signature consumes ~38,720 gas under Ethereum's model (vs 1,040 for ECDSA) \u2014 a 37\u00d7 fee increase, suggesting analogous economic impacts for Bitcoin fees.\n\n### 6.2 The Hybrid Approach\n\nBoth the [JBBA paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) and [Project Eleven's analysis](https://blog.projecteleven.com/posts/a-look-at-post-quantum-proposals-for-bitcoin) propose hybrid signatures: including both a classical secp256k1 signature and an ML-DSA signature in each transaction. This provides:\n\n- Security against classical adversaries (via ECDSA/Schnorr) if ML-DSA is broken\n- Security against quantum adversaries (via ML-DSA) if ECDSA is broken\n- Graceful degradation if either component fails\n\nBIP-360 already incorporates this thinking: \"P2QRH deliberately builds a hybrid: every output can include classical secp256k1 keys alongside one or more post-quantum keys.\" [Project Eleven](https://blog.projecteleven.com/posts/a-look-at-post-quantum-proposals-for-bitcoin)\n\nThe cost: a hybrid ML-DSA-65 transaction is ~3,420 bytes combined (vs ~250 bytes for ECDSA) \u2014 a 13.7\u00d7 size increase that is large but more manageable than SLH-DSA.\n\n### 6.3 BTQ's Proof-of-Concept Implementation\n\nIn October 2025, BTQ Technologies announced **Bitcoin Quantum Core Release 0.2** \u2014 [the first successful demonstration](https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/10/16/btq-technologies-announces-quantum-safe-bitcoin-using-nist-standardized-post-quantum-cryptography/) of a full quantum-resistant Bitcoin implementation using ML-DSA (FIPS 204). To accommodate the larger signatures, BTQ required:\n- A 64 MiB block size limit (vs Bitcoin's 1 MB)\n- Increased script limits\n\nThis demonstrates that ML-DSA *can* work in a Bitcoin-compatible codebase but confirms that block size changes would be necessary at scale without compression techniques.\n\n---\n\n## 7. BIP-360 Support for ML-DSA\n\nBIP-360 explicitly supports ML-DSA as one of three algorithms:\n\n> \"This library implements three NIST PQC standardized or candidate signature algorithms for use with BIP-360 and the Bitcoin QuBit soft fork: ML-DSA-44 (formerly CRYSTALS-Dilithium), SLH-DSA-Shake-128s (formerly SPHINCS+), FN-DSA-512 (formerly FALCON).\" \u2014 [libbitcoinpqc GitHub](https://github.com/cryptoquick/libbitcoinpqc)\n\nThe BIP-360 design stores PQ signatures in an **attestation field** separate from the witness, assigned a higher weight discount than standard witness data to mitigate the block space impact. The design uses algorithm identifiers (ML_DSA_44 = 0x10, ML_DSA_65 = 0x11, ML_DSA_87 = 0x12) to support algorithm agility.\n\nBIP-360 author Hunter Beast noted in [February 2025](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/9d6f01ca-9fab-4638-b59b-64db6301c2dbn@googlegroups.com/T/) that restricting to NIST-approved algorithms is preferable for FIPS compliance, and that ML-DSA-87 (NIST Level 5) is the current default: \"Ultimately, I hope the default of NIST V and selection of 3 mature NIST-approved algorithms demonstrate a focused, polished, and conservative proposal.\"\n\n---\n\n## 8. Summary Assessment\n\nML-DSA occupies the pragmatic center of Bitcoin's PQ options: not as conservative as SLH-DSA (which offers stronger security assumptions), not as compact as FN-DSA (which is harder to implement safely), but **well-balanced in security, implementation maturity, and institutional readiness**. Its selection as NIST's primary PQ signature standard and its already-demonstrated FIPS 204 compliance make it the most likely first deployed PQ signature scheme in Bitcoin if BIP-360 progresses.\n\nThe outstanding challenges \u2014 public key bloat in the UTXO set, BIP-32 incompatibility, and 38\u201374\u00d7 size increase over ECDSA \u2014 are engineering problems solvable through the attestation discount mechanism, a new HD derivation standard, and long-term STARK compression.\n\n*Cross-reference: [comparison-matrix.md](comparison-matrix.md) for all scheme sizes; [sphincs-plus.md](sphincs-plus.md) for the hash-based alternative; [falcon.md](falcon.md) for the compact lattice alternative.*\n",

How FALCON Works\n\nFALCON (Fast Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU) is a **lattice-based signature scheme** that achieves the smallest signature sizes among all NIST-selected PQ schemes. It is based on **NTRU lattices** and uses the **GPV (Gentry-Peikert-Vaikuntanathan) framework** for hash-and-sign signatures, instantiated via fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques.\n\n### 1.1 NTRU Lattice Foundation\n\nAn NTRU lattice is a two-dimensional module over a polynomial ring, structured so that \"short\" vectors in the lattice correspond to valid signature pairs. The private key defines a special short basis for this lattice; the public key exposes only a hard-to-invert description of the same lattice.\n\nThe security assumption is the hardness of the **NTRU problem** and the **Short Integer Solution (SIS)** problem over NTRU lattices. These are believed to be quantum-hard \u2014 no known quantum algorithm achieves a speedup beyond Grover-like attacks that are already accounted for in the parameter choices. [JBBA hybrid signatures paper (Dec 2025)](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf)\n\n### 1.2 Gaussian Sampling: The Critical Mechanism\n\nThe core signing operation in FALCON requires **discrete Gaussian sampling** \u2014 selecting a lattice vector according to a probability distribution shaped like a Gaussian (normal) bell curve centered on the target. This is what enables FALCON's compact signatures: by sampling from the narrow Gaussian distribution over the lattice, the signature reveals very little information about the secret basis.\n\nThe process involves:\n1. Hash the message to a target point in the lattice\n2. Use the secret basis (via fast Fourier sampling, the \"Klein sampler\") to find a short vector close to that target\n3. Output the short vector as the signature\n\nThe mathematical machinery requires computing Fast Fourier Transforms over polynomial rings, manipulating floating-point numbers, and applying complex statistical sampling algorithms. [PostQuantum.com PQC overview](https://postquantum.com/post-quantum/hybrid-cryptography-pqc/)\n\n### 1.3 Why FFT?\n\nThe \"FFT over NTRU Lattice\" in FN-DSA's name is not incidental \u2014 the Fast Fourier Transform is what makes FALCON computationally practical. Without it, the Gaussian sampling required for GPV signatures would be prohibitively slow. FFT reduces the polynomial multiplication complexity from O(n\u00b2) to O(n log n), enabling real-world signing speeds. This is also why the scheme's name changed: FN-DSA stands for \"FFT over NTRU-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm.\" [NIST announcement Aug 2024](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards)\n\n---\n\n## 2. NIST Standardization Status: FIPS 206\n\nFALCON was selected by NIST in July 2022 for standardization alongside ML-DSA, but its standardization has proceeded more slowly due to its mathematical complexity. Key dates:\n\n- **July 2022**: Selected as one of four algorithms for standardization\n- **August 13, 2024**: FIPS 204 (ML-DSA) and FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA) published; FALCON explicitly delayed due to complexity\n- **August 28, 2025**: NIST submitted the draft standard for FN-DSA (FIPS 206) for approval as Initial Public Draft\n- **Late 2026 / Early 2027**: Expected final FIPS 206 publication\n\n[DigiCert blog: \"Quantum-Ready FN-DSA (FIPS 206) Nears Draft Approval from NIST\" (Sep 2025)](https://www.digicert.com/blog/quantum-ready-fndsa-nears-draft-approval-from-nist)\n\nThe NIST announcement noted that FIPS 206, when released, would \"dub\" the algorithm **FN-DSA** (FFT over NTRU-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm). FIPS 206 may include \"adjustments to the way signing and sampling work\" per DigiCert's analysis \u2014 potentially expanding FALCON's role beyond what was initially envisioned.\n\nDigiCert explicitly stated it will not implement FN-DSA in production products until the standard is finalized, to \"avoid the naming and OID confusion that affected ML-DSA and SLH-DSA between their IPDs and final drafts.\" This illustrates the practical risk of deploying FALCON before FIPS 206 is complete.\n\n---\n\n## 3. All Parameter Sets with Sizes\n\nFALCON/FN-DSA has two primary parameter sets:\n\n| Parameter Set | NIST Level | PK (bytes) | SK (bytes) | Signature (bytes, avg) | Combined PK+Sig | vs ECDSA combined |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| FN-DSA-512 (FALCON-512) | Level 1 (~128-bit PQ) | 897 | 1,281 | ~666 | ~1,563 | ~16\u00d7 |\n| FN-DSA-1024 (FALCON-1024) | Level 5 (~256-bit PQ) | 1,793 | 2,305 | ~1,280 | ~3,073 | ~32\u00d7 |\n\n*Sources: [libbitcoinpqc GitHub (BIP-360 reference)](https://github.com/cryptoquick/libbitcoinpqc); [PostQuantum.com](https://postquantum.com/post-quantum/hybrid-cryptography-pqc/); [JBBA hybrid paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf)*\n\n**Important note on signature size**: Unlike ML-DSA and SLH-DSA, FALCON signatures are **variable-length** \u2014 the ~666 bytes for FN-DSA-512 is an average, with individual signatures ranging from roughly 617 to 809 bytes depending on the random sampling outcome. This variability creates complications for Bitcoin's scripting system, which benefits from predictable transaction sizes.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Pros: Smallest Lattice Signatures, Fast Verification, NTRU Diversity\n\n**Smallest signatures among NIST-selected lattice schemes**: FN-DSA-512's ~666-byte signature is approximately 5\u00d7 smaller than ML-DSA-44's 2,420 bytes. For Bitcoin, this is potentially significant: a FN-DSA-512 signature has a witnessed weight of ~166 vbytes (with SegWit 4\u00d7 discount), vs ~605 vbytes for ML-DSA-44 and ~1,964 vbytes for SLH-DSA-128s.\n\n**Fast verification**: Verification in FALCON is fast (no floating-point required for verification \u2014 only key generation and signing need the FFT Gaussian sampler). Verification speed is broadly comparable to ML-DSA, substantially faster than SLH-DSA.\n\n**Different mathematical structure from ML-DSA**: FALCON's NTRU lattice assumption is distinct from ML-DSA's Module-LWE assumption. If one lattice family were broken (by a mathematical breakthrough), the other might remain secure. This **algorithmic diversity** is why NIST standardized both. [NIST's standardization rationale](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards)\n\n**Already used in production**: Algorand has integrated FALCON into its State Proofs for quantum-resistant cross-chain verification. However, Algorand's controlled environment is distinct from Bitcoin's permissionless, heterogeneous full-node network, where hardware FPU variability remains a concern. [arXiv: SOK of Post-Quantum Attackers on Blockchain (Dec 2025)](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13333v1)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Cons: Complex Implementation, Side-Channel Risk, Hardware Dependence\n\n### 5.1 Floating-Point Arithmetic Creates Non-Determinism\n\nFALCON's signing requires high-precision floating-point arithmetic for the Klein/FFT Gaussian sampler. This creates a critical problem: **floating-point behavior varies by hardware**. The [JBBA hybrid paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) found \"6\u20138\u00d7 performance variation based on hardware FPU availability.\" \n\nOn hardware without a floating-point unit (FPU) \u2014 including many older devices and low-power hardware \u2014 FALCON signing must be emulated in software, leading to dramatic slowdowns. This is deeply problematic for Bitcoin, where:\n- Hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor, Coldcard) have limited processing capabilities\n- All full nodes must verify signatures, and node operators run heterogeneous hardware\n- Consensus-critical code must produce identical results on all hardware\n\n### 5.2 Side-Channel Attacks\n\nThe Gaussian sampling process is a well-known side-channel attack target. Timing variations in the FFT and rejection sampling can leak information about the secret key through power analysis, timing attacks, or electromagnetic analysis. Implementing FALCON securely in hardware wallets or constrained devices requires careful constant-time implementation \u2014 much harder than ML-DSA, which uses only integer arithmetic.\n\nThe [JBBA analysis](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) bluntly characterized this as \"The Performance Trap\": \"Teams choose FALCON for size, implement insecurely, and create vulnerabilities.\" DigiCert similarly warned it \"will not implement FN-DSA in production products until the standard is finalized\" to avoid implementation vulnerabilities.\n\n### 5.3 Variable Signature Length\n\nFALCON's signatures are probabilistically generated \u2014 their length varies with each signing attempt. Bitcoin's transaction format, fee calculation, and script validation benefit from predictable sizes. Variable-length signatures require more complex fee estimation and script limit handling. The BIP-360 library notes FN-DSA-512 produces \"~666 bytes (average)\" \u2014 the tilde is significant.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bitcoin-Specific Analysis\n\n### 6.1 Block Space Comparison\n\nFN-DSA-512 is the most Bitcoin-friendly of the NIST-standardized schemes from a pure size perspective:\n\n| Scheme | Sig (bytes) | PK (bytes) | Witnessed weight (vbytes) | Relative to ECDSA |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| ECDSA (secp256k1) | 64 | 33 | ~24.25 vbytes | 1\u00d7 |\n| FN-DSA-512 | ~666 | 897 | ~390 vbytes | ~16\u00d7 |\n| ML-DSA-44 | 2,420 | 1,312 | ~933 vbytes | ~38\u00d7 |\n| SLH-DSA-128s | 7,856 | 32 | ~1,972 vbytes | ~81\u00d7 |\n\nWith witness discounting, a FN-DSA-512 transaction (assuming the 4\u00d7 SegWit discount applies to signatures in the attestation structure) would be roughly 16\u00d7 the current weight \u2014 manageable compared to ML-DSA's 38\u00d7 and SLH-DSA's 81\u2013123\u00d7.\n\n### 6.2 BIP-360 Inclusion and Concerns\n\nFN-DSA-512 is one of three algorithms in [BIP-360's libbitcoinpqc library](https://github.com/cryptoquick/libbitcoinpqc), but it has attracted the most skepticism from reviewers:\n\n**Bitcoin developer Tim Ruffing** raised concerns about BIP-360's multi-algorithm approach on the Bitcoin dev mailing list, noting: \"all new cryptographic schemes added to the consensus protocol need to be exceptionally well specified and implemented... That said, it makes a lot of sense to design a hybrid scheme that also provides security against a classic attacker through an established signature scheme.\" [P2QRH / BIP-360 Update mailing list thread (Feb 2025)](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/9d6f01ca-9fab-4638-b59b-64db6301c2dbn@googlegroups.com/T/)\n\n**Hunter Beast** (BIP-360 lead author) acknowledged in the same thread that SQIsign was removed from BIP-360 due to \"15,000\u00d7 slower verification compared to ECC\" \u2014 a warning that also partially applies to FALCON's FPU-dependent variability. The concern is whether Bitcoin full nodes running on slower hardware could handle FALCON verification at network scale.\n\n### 6.3 FIPS 206 Timing Problem\n\nA practical issue for Bitcoin's governance timeline: FIPS 206 (FN-DSA) is expected to be finalized in **late 2026 or early 2027** \u2014 likely after BIP-360 has advanced through much of its standardization review. Using a non-finalized draft standard in a Bitcoin soft fork proposal creates legal and technical uncertainty. Some reviewers have argued Bitcoin should wait for FIPS 206 finalization before committing to FN-DSA. [DigiCert FN-DSA analysis (Sep 2025)](https://www.digicert.com/blog/quantum-ready-fndsa-nears-draft-approval-from-nist)\n\n### 6.4 Signature Aggregation Potential\n\nBTQ Technologies [reported pioneering](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/btq-technologies-demonstrates-quantum-safe-bitcoin-using-nist-standardized-post-quantum-cryptography-protecting-2-trillion-market-at-risk-302585981.html) \"NIST standardized Falcon signature aggregation techniques\" \u2014 suggesting that aggregating FALCON signatures (reducing multiple signatures to a single compact proof) may be feasible, which would substantially reduce the on-chain footprint if implemented in Bitcoin.\n\nAlgorand has deployed FALCON in production, and [research via Ethereum's StarkWare collaboration](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.13333v1) demonstrated the first FALCON signature verification on StarkNet (an Ethereum L2), marking \"a step toward quantum-safe infrastructure within the ecosystem\" \u2014 a potential template for Bitcoin STARK compression.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Summary Assessment\n\nFALCON/FN-DSA is the **most space-efficient** NIST PQ signature option, but also the **most dangerous to implement** for a consensus-critical system. Its value proposition for Bitcoin is clear: ~666-byte signatures are 5\u00d7 smaller than ML-DSA-44 and potentially viable for block space without massive block size increases.\n\nHowever, the complexity of Gaussian sampling, hardware-dependent performance variations, and side-channel risks make it a poor choice for Bitcoin's first PQ deployment. The emerging consensus among Bitcoin developers is that ML-DSA should serve as the safe primary choice, with FN-DSA available for sophisticated users who need its smaller size and can guarantee secure implementation \u2014 particularly institutional custodians with dedicated HSMs.\n\nOnce FIPS 206 is finalized (expected late 2026\u2013early 2027), the case for FN-DSA in Bitcoin will strengthen considerably. Its unique combination of small signatures and NTRU-based security diversity positions it as a long-term complement to ML-DSA, not a replacement.\n\n*Cross-reference: [comparison-matrix.md](comparison-matrix.md) for all scheme sizes side by side; [crystals-dilithium.md](crystals-dilithium.md) for the simpler lattice alternative; [other-candidates.md](other-candidates.md) for hybrid approaches.*\n",

The One-Time / Few-Time / Many-Time Distinction\n\nHash-based signatures are organized by how many times a single key pair can be safely used:\n\n| Category | Scheme | Uses per key | Key management |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **One-Time Signature (OTS)** | Lamport, WOTS+ | 1 | Very simple; discard after use |\n| **Few-Time Signature (FTS)** | FORS (in SPHINCS+) | ~2\u20138 (with security degradation per use) | Internal to SPHINCS+ |\n| **Many-Time Signature (stateful)** | XMSS, LMS, SHRINCS | 2^h (fixed maximum, e.g., 1,024 to 2^30) | Requires state tracking |\n| **Many-Time Signature (stateless)** | SPHINCS+/SLH-DSA | Unlimited (2^64 per key) | No state needed |\n\nThe fundamental tradeoff: stateless schemes (SPHINCS+) pay a large size penalty for the freedom of unrestricted use. Stateful schemes (XMSS, LMS) are far more compact but require careful state management to prevent catastrophic key reuse.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Lamport Signatures\n\n### 2.1 How They Work\n\nProposed by Leslie Lamport in 1979, Lamport signatures are the simplest quantum-resistant signature scheme:\n\n**Key generation**: For a 256-bit message hash, generate 256 pairs of 256-bit random values: `{(sk\u2080\u2070, sk\u2080\u00b9), (sk\u2081\u2070, sk\u2081\u00b9), ..., (sk\u2082\u2085\u2085\u2070, sk\u2082\u2085\u2085\u00b9)}`. Hash each value to produce the public key: `pk\u1d62\u02b2 = H(sk\u1d62\u02b2)`.\n\n**Signing**: For each bit `i` of the message hash:\n- If bit `i` = 0, reveal `sk\u2080\u1d62` \n- If bit `i` = 1, reveal `sk\u2081\u1d62`\n\n**Verification**: For each bit `i`, check that `H(revealed_value) = pk\u1d62^(bit value)`.\n\n**Why it's quantum-secure**: The signature consists of hash preimages. Breaking Lamport signatures requires inverting a cryptographic hash \u2014 a problem believed to be hard even for quantum computers (Grover's algorithm provides only a quadratic speedup, which is addressed by using 256-bit hashes for 128-bit quantum security).\n\n**Why it's one-time only**: Revealing one secret value per bit exposes the half of each pair that was hidden. After two signatures, an attacker has both members of many pairs and can forge signatures. [Rootstock Labs: Lamport and Winternitz for Bitcoin (Aug 2024)](https://www.rootstocklabs.com/blog/exploring-lamport-and-winternitz-signatures-for-stateful-bitcoin-scripts/)\n\n### 2.2 Lamport Size in Bitcoin Context\n\nA standard 256-bit Lamport signature contains 128 revealed 256-bit (32-byte) values = **4,096 bytes**. The public key is 256 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 32 = **16,384 bytes** (though it can be compressed to 32 bytes by hashing). For Bitcoin transactions, even compressing the public key, the raw signature approaches the size of SLH-DSA-128s but without a standardized framework or reusability.\n\nLamport keys can be generated deterministically from a seed (32 bytes), making private key management feasible.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Winternitz One-Time Signatures (WOTS+)\n\n### 3.1 How They Work\n\nProposed by Robert Winternitz (and extended by Andreas H\u00fclsing to WOTS+), Winternitz signatures dramatically reduce Lamport's size by signing multiple bits per chain rather than one bit per secret value.\n\n**Key setup**: Choose a Winternitz parameter `w` (typically 4 or 16). Divide the message hash into `\u2113\u2081 = \u2308n/log\u2082(w)\u2309` base-w digits, plus a checksum `\u2113\u2082` value. Total signature length = `\u2113 = \u2113\u2081 + \u2113\u2082` elements.\n\n**Chain computation**: For each secret value `sk_i`, define a hash chain of length `w-1`: `f\u2070(sk_i) = sk_i, f\u00b9(sk_i) = H(sk_i), ..., f^(w-1)(sk_i) = H^(w-1)(sk_i)`. The public key element `pk_i = f^(w-1)(sk_i)`.\n\n**Signing**: For each message digit `m_i` (in base w), reveal `f^(w-1-m_i)(sk_i)` \u2014 i.e., the chain value at position `w-1-m_i` from the start.\n\n**Verification**: Apply the hash function `m_i` more times to the revealed value and check it matches `pk_i`. [Rootstock Labs analysis](https://www.rootstocklabs.com/blog/exploring-lamport-and-winternitz-signatures-for-stateful-bitcoin-scripts/)\n\n**The checksum**: Without a checksum, an attacker could forge signatures on messages with smaller digit values (by \"advancing\" the hash chain). The checksum ensures that any modification to the message increases some digits while decreasing others, making forgery infeasible.\n\n### 3.2 Size and Bitcoin Viability\n\nWith `w=16, n=32` (Bitcoin's SHA-256 output), WOTS+ requires `\u2113\u2081 = \u2308256/4\u2309 = 64` plus `\u2113\u2082 \u2248 3` checksum elements = ~67 elements \u00d7 32 bytes = **~2,144 bytes** for the raw signature, reducible to ~1,088 bytes with public-key compression techniques.\n\nThe SHRINCS construction (Section 6) uses **WOTS+C** \u2014 a further compressed variant \u2014 achieving just **292 bytes** per one-time signature at NIST security level 1. [SHRINCS Delving Bitcoin post (Dec 2025)](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/shrincs-324-byte-stateful-post-quantum-signatures-with-static-backups/2158)\n\n[Conduition's analysis for Bitcoin (Oct 2024)](https://conduition.io/cryptography/quantum-hbs/) calculated that compact WOTS+ with deterministic key generation produces public and private keys of constant 32-byte size and signatures **slightly more than 1 KB** \u2014 \"Verification would require at most 8,670 hash invocations, which takes only a few milliseconds on most modern machines.\"\n\n**Trade-off**: Larger `w` \u2192 fewer elements \u2192 smaller signatures, but exponentially more computation (hash function evaluations) for signing and verification. `w=16` is NIST's recommended balance.\n\n---\n\n## 4. XMSS: eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme\n\n### 4.1 How It Works\n\nXMSS (RFC 8391, NIST SP 800-208) extends WOTS+ from one-time to many-time use via a **Merkle tree**:\n\n1. Generate 2^h WOTS+ key pairs\n2. Compute a binary Merkle tree over their public keys: each leaf is a hash of a WOTS+ public key; each internal node is a hash of its two children; the root is the XMSS public key\n3. To sign message `i`, use the i-th WOTS+ key pair, and include the **authentication path** \u2014 the sibling nodes along the path from leaf `i` to the root\n4. The verifier reconstructs the root from the WOTS+ signature, leaf, and authentication path, and checks it matches the public key\n\n**State**: The critical state variable is the counter `q` \u2014 which leaf index has been used next.

Key differences from XMSS:\n\n- LMS uses SHA-256 exclusively (XMSS is more parameterizable)\n- LMS has a simpler, more IETF-standard-friendly API\n- The Winternitz parameter options differ (NIST notes `w=4` in LMS is roughly comparable to `w=16` in XMSS)\n\n**HSS (Hierarchical Signature System)**: A multi-tree extension of LMS, analogous to XMSS^MT. HSS allows billions of signatures by nesting LMS trees. [NIST SP 800-208](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-208.pdf)\n\n### 5.2 LMS Parameter Sets and Sizes\n\n| Parameter Set | Sig (bytes) | Max signatures |\n|---|---|---|\n| L1_H15_W2 | 4,784 | 32,768 |\n| L1_H15_W4 | 2,672 | 32,768 |\n| L2_H10_W2 (HSS) | 9,300 | 1,048,576 |\n\n*Source: [wolfSSL LMS/HSS documentation](https://www.wolfssl.com/documentation/manuals/wolfssl/appendix07.html)*\n\nNIST SP 800-208 (Oct 2020) approved XMSS and LMS for use in signed firmware, code signing, and software update scenarios \u2014 explicitly **not** for general-purpose signatures, due to statefulness constraints.\n\n---\n\n## 6. The Statefulness Problem for Bitcoin\n\nStatefulness is the defining problem for XMSS and LMS in Bitcoin. The consequences of state mismanagement are severe:\n\n**Catastrophic key reuse**: Using the same WOTS+ leaf twice reveals enough of the private key that an attacker can forge arbitrary signatures. In Bitcoin, this means funds are permanently accessible to an attacker. Unlike ECDSA nonce reuse (which is also devastating), WOTS+ double-use may not be immediately detectable.\n\n**Seed phrase restoration resets state**: Bitcoin users routinely restore wallets from 12 or 24-word BIP-39 seed phrases. In any stateless derivation scheme, restoring from seed gives a counter value of 0 \u2014 regardless of how many signatures were previously generated. If a user restores a wallet and signs one transaction, they have reused leaf 0 from a key that may have already been used.\n\n[NIST SP 800-208](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-208.pdf) addresses this by requiring stateful schemes to \"be implemented in hardware cryptographic modules that do not allow secret keying material to be exported\" \u2014 essentially mandating HSMs that maintain state internally. This standard is incompatible with Bitcoin's consumer hardware wallet model.\n\n[Keyfactor documentation (Feb 2026)](https://docs.keyfactor.com/ejbca/latest/post-quantum-cryptography-keys-and-signatures): \"NIST standards for using post-quantum algorithms and corresponding HSM compatibility are still under development. LMS/HSS is standardized in PKCS#11 v3.1.\"\n\n**SHRINCS solution (Jonas Nick, Dec 2025)**: A hybrid approach published on [Delving Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/shrincs-324-byte-stateful-post-quantum-signatures-with-static-backups/2158) by Jonas Nick (Blockstream Research) combines an **unbalanced XMSS tree** (stateful, used when state is intact) with **SPHINCS+** (stateless fallback, used when state is uncertain or after seed restoration). \n\nFor `q=1` (first spend from a key):\n- Stateful path signature: 292 (WOTS+C) + 16 (q\u00d716 auth path bytes) + 16 (pk\u2082) = **~324 bytes**\n- This is 11\u00d7 smaller than ML-DSA-44's 2,420 bytes\n\n[Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #391 (Feb 2026)](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2026/02/06/) summarized: \"SHRINCS offers a compromise where a stateful signature is used when the fidelity of the key+state can be known with certainty, but falls back to stateless signing at higher cost if there is doubt that the state is valid.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. Lamport via OP_CAT: The Bitcoin Construction\n\n### 7.1 The OP_CAT Lamport Proposal\n\nThe clearest path to deploying Lamport-style signatures on Bitcoin today runs through **OP_CAT** (BIP-347). Ethan Heilman and Armin Sabouri proposed restoring OP_CAT, which was disabled by Satoshi in 2010 due to exponential stack growth risks \u2014 a risk now mitigated by Tapscript's 520-byte stack element limit.\n\n[Ethan Heilman's OP_CAT BIP draft (Oct 2023)](https://github.com/EthanHeilman/op_cat_draft/blob/main/cat.mediawiki) explicitly lists \"Post-Quantum Lamport Signatures in Bitcoin transactions\" as a key use case: \"Lamport signatures merely require the ability to hash and concatenate values on the stack.\"\n\n### 7.2 Jeremy Rubin's 20-Byte Construction\n\n[Jeremy Rubin (July 2021)](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CAD5xwhgzR8e5r1e4H-5EH2mSsE1V39dd06+TgYniFnXFSBqLxw@mail.gmail.com/) showed that with OP_CAT, one can construct a Lamport signature over a 20-byte HASH160 digest:\n\n- 20-byte hash = 160 bits = 160 key pairs\n- Script size: 20 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 55.375 = 8,860 bytes \u2014 fitting within the ~10,000-byte Tapscript limit\n- Stack: 160 elements \u00d7 3,360 bytes total\n\nThis construction signs an ECDSA signature with a Lamport key \u2014 making the transaction quantum-safe even if secp256k1 is broken, because the ECDSA signature (and hence the transaction) is committed to by a Lamport signature whose security is purely hash-based.\n\n**OP_CAT also enables Winternitz**: A separate [bitcoin-dev mailing list proposal](https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/c2abfd68-f118-4951-ba4a-499fc819332f@gmail.com) demonstrated that OP_CAT enables WOTS \u2014 a more efficient alternative to Lamport that dramatically reduces signature sizes.\n\n### 7.3 Reusability via Taproot Trees\n\nRubin's construction enables reuse by committing multiple Lamport key pairs in a Taproot tree: \"There could be many Lamport keys committed inside a taproot tree so that an address could be used for thousands of times before expiring.\" Each spend reveals one Lamport key path. This extends the one-time signature to many-time use within a fixed tree structure \u2014 without external state management.\n\n---\n\n## 8.

SQIsign: Isogeny-Based Compact Signatures\n\n### 1.1 What SQIsign Is\n\nSQIsign (Short Quaternion and Isogeny Signature) is a post-quantum digital signature scheme based on **supersingular elliptic curve isogenies**. It is currently in **NIST Round 2 of the Additional Signatures evaluation** (the separate process NIST launched in 2022 to diversify beyond lattice assumptions).\n\nSQIsign's defining feature is extraordinary compactness. [According to its Round 2 specification (Feb 2025)](https://sqisign.org/spec/sqisign-20250205.pdf):\n\n> \"To our knowledge, SQIsign has the smallest combined size of public key and signature of any post-quantum signature scheme. In particular, they are about 7\u00d7 smaller than Falcon (to be standardized as FN-DSA), and 16\u201317\u00d7 smaller than ML-DSA.\"\n\n| Parameter Set | Public Key (bytes) | Signature (bytes) | Combined (bytes) | vs ECDSA combined |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| SQIsign NIST-I | 65 | 148 | 213 | ~2.2\u00d7 |\n| SQIsign NIST-III | 97 | 224 | 321 | ~3.3\u00d7 |\n| SQIsign NIST-V | 129 | 292 | 421 | ~4.3\u00d7 |\n\n*Source: [SQIsign official website / specification](https://sqisign.org); [NIST CSRC Round 2 spec](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Projects/pqc-dig-sig/documents/round-2/spec-files/sqisign-spec-round2-web.pdf)*\n\nAt NIST-I, SQIsign's combined 213 bytes is only 2.2\u00d7 ECDSA's 97 bytes \u2014 by far the closest to current Bitcoin transaction sizes of any PQ scheme. For context, this is 7\u00d7 smaller than FN-DSA-512 and 17\u00d7 smaller than ML-DSA-44.\n\n### 1.2 How SQIsign Works\n\nSQIsign is a sigma-protocol (identification scheme) converted to a signature via Fiat-Shamir. The security relies on the **Endomorphism Ring Problem** for supersingular elliptic curves \u2014 given a supersingular curve E, it is computationally hard to find its endomorphism ring End(E) without knowing the secret isogeny path.\n\nSigning requires:\n1. Key generation: Select a secret isogeny path from a canonical starting curve E\u2080 to a public curve E_A\n2. Commitment: Choose a random isogeny to create a challenge curve\n3. Response: Compute a \"response isogeny\" using the secret and challenge\n\nThe mathematical machinery involves computing high-degree isogenies between supersingular curves, which is inherently expensive. Performance at NIST-I (per the [SQIsign specification](https://sqisign.org)):\n\n| Operation | Performance (Megacycles) | Clock time (3 GHz) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Key generation | 43.3 Mc | ~14 ms |\n| Signing | 101.6 Mc | ~34 ms |\n| Verification | 5.1 Mc | ~1.7 ms |\n\nCompared to ML-DSA verification at ~0.2 ms, SQIsign verification is ~8\u00d7 slower. However, the earlier versions were dramatically worse \u2014 earlier benchmarks showed 15,000\u00d7 slower verification than ECDSA, and significant improvements have been made through the \"SQIsign2D\" and \"SQIsign2D-West\" optimizations.\n\n### 1.3 Why SQIsign Was Dropped from BIP-360\n\n[BIP-360 author Hunter Beast explicitly removed SQIsign](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/9d6f01ca-9fab-4638-b59b-64db6301c2dbn@googlegroups.com/T/) from the proposal: \"While we originally considered SQIsign, it has 15,000\u00d7 slower verification compared to ECC.\" Even with recent improvements, Bitcoin reviewers raised that SQIsign \"lacks implementation maturity.\"\n\nThe SIKE break (July 2022) \u2014 where a different isogeny-based scheme was broken with a 62-minute classical attack \u2014 damaged confidence in isogeny-based cryptography broadly, even though SQIsign uses different mathematical structures (endomorphism rings rather than SIDH). [PostQuantum.com PQC overview](https://postquantum.com/post-quantum/cryptography-pqc-nist/)\n\n### 1.4 Bitcoin Relevance Assessment\n\nSQIsign's compact signatures are an almost perfect fit for Bitcoin's block space constraints. The 148-byte NIST-I signature with 65-byte public key would barely expand transaction sizes beyond current norms. However:\n\n- Verification is too slow for Bitcoin's global full-node network at current performance levels\n- Implementation complexity is extreme (requires specialized mathematical libraries)\n- Cryptographic maturity is insufficient \u2014 SQIsign is in Round 2 of additional evaluation, years from standardization\n- The post-SIKE wariness means it needs years more analysis\n\nIf SQIsign survives ongoing cryptanalysis and achieves verification speeds within 5\u201310\u00d7 of ML-DSA, it would become Bitcoin's most attractive long-term option. The research community should be watched closely. [SQIsign specification Jan 2025](https://sqisign.org/spec/sqisign-20250205.pdf)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Multivariate Signature Schemes\n\n### 2.1 What They Are\n\nMultivariate signature schemes base security on the hardness of solving systems of multivariate quadratic equations over finite fields (the \"MQ problem\"). They typically offer **small signatures** but very **large public keys**.\n\n### 2.2 Rainbow and GeMSS: Broken\n\n**Rainbow** was a NIST Round 3 finalist. In March 2022, Ward Beullens published [a practical key recovery attack](https://www.cryptomathic.com/blog/nist-pqc-finalists-update-its-over-for-the-rainbow) that broke Rainbow's Category 1 parameters \"in a weekend on a laptop\" \u2014 a catastrophic failure for a finalist scheme. Rainbow was eliminated from the NIST process. [NIST PKC 2022 presentation](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2022/the-beginning-of-the-end-the-first-nist-pqc-standa/images-media/pkc2022-march2022-moody.pdf)\n\n**GeMSS** was a Round 3 alternate candidate with enormous public keys (~352 KB) and tiny 33-byte signatures. It was successfully attacked and also eliminated.\n\n### 2.3 Surviving Multivariate Candidates\n\nPost-break, NIST's additional signatures call attracted new multivariate proposals:\n\n**MAYO**: A variant of Unbalanced Oil-and-Vinegar (UOV) modified to resist the attacks that broke Rainbow. Currently in NIST Round 2. If MAYO survives analysis, it could offer small signatures (~100\u2013400 bytes) with more manageable public keys than classic UOV.\n\n**UOV variants (QR-UOV)**: Quasi-ring UOV and similar constructions are attempting to reduce public key sizes using algebraic structure while maintaining security.\n\n**Status for Bitcoin**: No multivariate scheme should be considered for Bitcoin deployment until at least one completes a full NIST standardization process. The rapid breaks of Rainbow and GeMSS are strong warnings about this class of schemes. [PostQuantum.com Additional Signatures analysis (2025)](https://postquantum.com/post-quantum/cryptography-pqc-nist/)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Code-Based Signature Schemes\n\n### 3.1 Status\n\nCode-based cryptography (security based on decoding random linear codes \u2014 the \"syndrome decoding problem\") has produced NIST-approved **key encapsulation** mechanisms (HQC was selected for standardization in March 2025) but has not yet produced competitive **signature** schemes for the NIST portfolio.\n\nCurrent code-based signature candidates in NIST Round 2:\n\n**CROSS**: Based on random linear codes. Signature sizes are moderate (similar to SLH-DSA). Not yet a strong candidate for Bitcoin due to size constraints.\n\n**LESS**: Less common variant, still under analysis.\n\n### 3.2 Classic McEliece for Signatures\n\nClassic McEliece (a code-based KEM with enormous public keys \u2014 ~256 KB to 1.3 MB) is explicitly unsuitable for Bitcoin. While it offers extremely conservative security assumptions, its public key sizes would be catastrophic for both transaction verification and UTXO set storage. [PostQuantum.com](https://postquantum.com/post-quantum/cryptography-pqc-nist/)\n\n**Status for Bitcoin**: Code-based signatures remain far from Bitcoin-ready. They require further development and standardization before consideration.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hybrid Classical + Post-Quantum Approaches\n\n### 4.1 What Hybrid Signatures Are\n\nHybrid signatures combine a classical signature (ECDSA or Schnorr secp256k1) with a PQ signature. The transaction is valid only if **both** signatures verify. Security guarantees:\n\n- **Against classical adversary**: min(ECDSA security, PQ security) \u2014 effectively ECDSA's 128-bit security\n- **Against quantum adversary**: PQ security only (since ECDSA is broken by Shor's algorithm)\n- **Against cryptographic failure**: If either scheme is broken classically, the other provides backup\n\n[JBBA hybrid paper (Dec 2025)](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf): \"Hybrid signatures provide insurance against algorithmic failure, not multiplicative security. They are a transitional mechanism, not a permanent solution.\"\n\n### 4.2 BIP-360's Hybrid Design\n\nBIP-360 (P2MR / P2QRH) is explicitly designed as a hybrid system. From [Project Eleven's analysis](https://blog.projecteleven.com/posts/a-look-at-post-quantum-proposals-for-bitcoin):\n\n> \"P2QRH deliberately builds a hybrid: every output can include classical secp256k1 keys alongside one or more post-quantum keys. That way, if someone finds a flaw in a PQC scheme, you still have your ECC fallback.\"\n\nThe attestation structure in BIP-360 uses algorithm type bytes (e.g., ML_DSA_44 = 0x10, FN_DSA_512 = 0x20, FUTURE_ALG = 0xFF) to allow hybrid combinations.\n\n### 4.3 Combined Sizes for Hybrid Transactions\n\n| Hybrid Configuration | Total approx. size | vs ECDSA-only |\n|---|---|---|\n| secp256k1 + FN-DSA-512 | ~97 + ~1,563 = ~1,660 bytes | ~17\u00d7 |\n| secp256k1 + ML-DSA-44 | ~97 + ~3,732 = ~3,829 bytes | ~39\u00d7 |\n| secp256k1 + ML-DSA-65 | ~97 + ~5,261 = ~5,358 bytes | ~55\u00d7 |\n| secp256k1 + SLH-DSA-128s | ~97 + ~7,888 = ~7,985 bytes | ~82\u00d7 |\n\nThe [JBBA paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) estimated that hybrid ML-DSA-44 transactions would be 35.6\u00d7 ECDSA combined, and hybrid FN-DSA-512 transactions 10.9\u00d7 \u2014 making FN-DSA the more practical hybrid choice for Bitcoin's block space.\n\n### 4.4 Matt Corallo's OP_SPHINCS Hybrid via Taproot\n\nThe most Bitcoin-philosophy-aligned hybrid approach is Matt Corallo's Taproot-based design: embed a SPHINCS+ commitment in a Taproot script leaf with **zero current overhead**, creating a hidden quantum fallback. Users spend via Schnorr key-path today; if quantum threats materialize, they reveal the script path containing the PQ signature.\n\n[As Corallo explained (Feb 2026)](https://cryptobriefing.com/matt-corallo-most-crypto-wallets-are-quantum-safe-bitcoins-soft-fork-could-require-proof-of-seed-phrase-ownership-and-the-ethereum-foundation-is-leading-in-quantum-threat-response-unchained/): \"You can start using addresses that commit to post-quantum hash-based signatures\" \u2014 referring to wallets that embed SPHINCS+ in hidden Taproot script paths today without revealing them until needed.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Novel Bitcoin-Specific Proposals\n\n### 5.1 NTC via STARKs (Ethan Heilman)\n\nEthan Heilman (BIP-360 co-author) proposed **Naive Transaction Compression (NTC) via STARKs**: aggregate all post-quantum signatures in a block into a single STARK proof. Key details from [LinkedIn BIP-360 7-year timeline analysis (Feb 2026)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-dinarian-262a46239_bitcoin-may-take-7-years-to-upgrade-to-post-quantum-activity-7431056197459374080-QSnT):\n\n- Ethereum's post-quantum team has a working STARK prototype\n- Justin Drake (Ethereum) hopes \"Bitcoin will adopt it as the industry standard\"\n- Could reduce effective on-chain PQ signature footprint by ~10\u00d7 per the [JBBA estimate](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf)\n- Bitcoin philosophical tension: STARKs require new consensus rules and trust in a more complex verification system than current Script\n\n### 5.2 SHRINCS (Jonas Nick, Dec 2025)\n\n[SHRINCS (Delving Bitcoin, Dec 2025)](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/shrincs-324-byte-stateful-post-quantum-signatures-with-static-backups/2158) is a Bitcoin-specific hybrid hash-based scheme combining SPHINCS+ (stateless fallback) with unbalanced XMSS (efficient stateful primary). At ~308\u2013324 bytes for first-spend signatures, it is 11\u00d7 smaller than ML-DSA while remaining purely hash-based.\n\n### 5.3 Tim Ruffing's Taproot PQ Analysis (Blockstream Research)\n\nTim Ruffing (Blockstream Research) published a formal security analysis confirming that [Taproot's hidden script paths are secure against quantum adversaries](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-quantum-risk-is-real-one-solution-might-start-with-taproot): even if Schnorr (the key path) is broken by a quantum computer, the committed script path containing a PQ signature remains trustworthy. This was a deliberate design property of Taproot, formally verified by Ruffing's paper.\n\n---\n\n## 6. The Algorithm Agility Argument\n\n### 6.1 Why Multiple Schemes Matter\n\nNo single PQ scheme can be trusted with certainty in 2026. History provides cautionary examples: Rainbow broke despite being a NIST finalist; SIKE broke completely within weeks of intense cryptanalysis; even well-studied schemes like XMSS have edge-case state management failures. [Cryptomathic: Rainbow break analysis (Mar 2022)](https://www.cryptomathic.com/blog/nist-pqc-finalists-update-its-over-for-the-rainbow)\n\nAlgorithm agility \u2014 the ability to swap cryptographic schemes without breaking the system \u2014 is the engineering response to this reality.\n\n### 6.2 BIP-360's Algorithm Agility Design\n\nBIP-360 is explicitly designed for algorithm agility. From the [libbitcoinpqc README](https://github.com/cryptoquick/libbitcoinpqc): the library implements three schemes (ML-DSA-44, SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s, FN-DSA-512) and uses algorithm identifier bytes. A `FUTURE_ALG = 0xFF` placeholder in the attestation structure allows future schemes to be added without redesigning the output format.\n\nHunter Beast articulated the rationale: \"It's not 100% certain that all of these algorithms will remain quantum resistant for all time, so redundancy here is\u2026 key.\" [Bitcoin Dev Mailing List Feb 2025](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/9d6f01ca-9fab-4638-b59b-64db6301c2dbn@googlegroups.com/T/)\n\nMatt Corallo added: \"Requiring two different signature schemes can mitigate risks\" \u2014 if one scheme is found to have weaknesses, the other provides continued security. [Crypto Briefing / Matt Corallo Feb 2026](https://cryptobriefing.com/matt-corallo-most-crypto-wallets-are-quantum-safe-bitcoins-soft-fork-could-require-proof-of-seed-phrase-ownership-and-the-ethereum-foundation-is-leading-in-quantum-threat-response-unchained/)\n\n### 6.3 The Opposing View: Complexity Risk\n\nBitcoin developer Tim Ruffing expressed concern on the bitcoin-dev mailing list: \"I am not quite convinced that adding three PQ schemes to the Bitcoin consensus protocol is a great solution to the problem of not being sure which exact scheme to pick. Offloading this decision to users does not really solve this problem. Moreover, this adds massive complexity and new cryptographic assumptions to the protocol.\" [P2QRH Update mailing list (Feb 2025)](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/9d6f01ca-9fab-4638-b59b-64db6301c2dbn@googlegroups.com/T/)\n\nThis reflects Bitcoin's conservative philosophy: simpler consensus rules are more secure, and adding three new cryptographic systems introduces three new attack surfaces.\n\n### 6.4 Resolution: NIST Restriction as Quality Filter\n\nBIP-360's restriction to NIST-approved algorithms (ML-DSA via FIPS 204, SLH-DSA via FIPS 205, and FN-DSA via draft FIPS 206) provides a principled quality filter: only schemes that have survived multi-year public cryptanalysis by the global cryptographic community are included. This addresses Ruffing's concern about maturity while preserving the diversity that guards against single-scheme failure.\n\nThe [MEXC post-quantum analysis (Jan 2026)](https://www.mexc.co/en-PH/news/569194) captures the industry alignment: \"NIST finalized its first post-quantum standards in 2024, FIPS 203, 204, and 205, and selected HQC as a backup key encapsulation mechanism while advancing Falcon and FN-DSA toward draft stages.

How SPHINCS+ Works\n\nSPHINCS+ is a **stateless hash-based signature scheme** \u2014 the most conservative approach to post-quantum signatures because its security reduces entirely to the preimage resistance and collision resistance of its underlying hash function (SHA-256 or SHAKE-256). No new mathematical assumptions are required beyond what Bitcoin's block mining already depends on.\n\n### 1.1 The Construction: Hyper-Tree of One-Time Signatures\n\nSPHINCS+ builds on three components stacked in a hierarchy:\n\n**WOTS+ (Winternitz One-Time Signature Plus)**: The leaf-level component. WOTS+ signs a single message by revealing partial hash chains. It is a one-time signature scheme \u2014 each WOTS+ key can sign exactly one message securely. WOTS+ uses a Winternitz parameter `w=16`, trading more hash computation for shorter signatures compared to naive Lamport.\n\n**XMSS subtree layer (Merkle trees)**: Multiple WOTS+ public keys are organized into a binary Merkle tree. The root of the tree is a single short hash value. To verify a WOTS+ signature, the verifier reconstructs the leaf and checks the authentication path up to the root. A single XMSS subtree of height `h'` can authenticate 2^h' different WOTS+ keys.\n\n**Hypertree structure**: SPHINCS+ stacks `d` layers of XMSS subtrees. The root of the top-level tree is the public key. Each lower-level subtree root is signed by the WOTS+ key at the leaf of the tree above it. This creates a chain of trust from the public key root down to the specific WOTS+ key used to sign the actual message.\n\n**FORS (Forest of Random Subsets)**: Before WOTS+ signs, SPHINCS+ uses FORS \u2014 a few-time signature scheme \u2014 to sign a hash of the message. FORS provides a cryptographic binding between the message and the chosen signing path in the hypertree, enabling the scheme to be used more than once per public key (up to 2^64 times for standard parameter sets) without key reuse attacks.\n\nThe key insight enabling statelessness: the signing path through the hypertree is derived *pseudorandomly* from the message and a secret seed, so no counter state needs to be tracked. [SPHINCS+ specification r3.1](https://sphincs.org/data/sphincs+-r3.1-specification.pdf)\n\n---\n\n## 2. NIST Standardization: FIPS 205\n\nSPHINCS+ was standardized by NIST as **SLH-DSA** (Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm) under [FIPS 205](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final), published **August 13, 2024**. This was one of the three initial post-quantum signature standards released alongside ML-DSA (FIPS 204) and with FN-DSA (FIPS 206) still in draft.\n\nNIST's rationale for standardizing SLH-DSA alongside the lattice-based schemes: it was \"the only third-round finalist signature that wasn't lattice-based or broken,\" providing an important non-lattice backup in case lattice problems are ever compromised. [PostQuantum.com PQC Standardization Overview](https://postquantum.com/post-quantum/cryptography-pqc-nist/)\n\nNIST is also working on additional parameter sets with a 2^24 signature limit (reduced from 2^64) that achieve smaller signatures \u2014 called rls128cs1, rls192cs1, rls256cs1 \u2014 targeting certificate, software, and firmware signing use cases. [NIST CSRC presentation \"Smaller SLH-DSA\" (Sep 2025)](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/presentations/2025/sphincs-smaller-parameter-sets/sphincs-dang_2.2.pdf)\n\n---\n\n## 3. All Parameter Sets with Sizes\n\nFIPS 205 defines 12 parameter sets covering three security levels, two hash functions (SHA-2 and SHAKE), and two optimization targets ('s' = small signatures, 'f' = fast signing). Public key sizes are derived from the secret seed and are remarkably small.\n\n| Parameter Set | n (bytes) | h | d | Security Level | PK (bytes) | SK (bytes) | Signature (bytes) | vs ECDSA sig |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s | 16 | 63 | 7 | 128-bit PQ | 32 | 64 | **7,856** | ~123\u00d7 |\n| SLH-DSA-SHA2-128f | 16 | 66 | 22 | 128-bit PQ | 32 | 64 | **17,088** | ~267\u00d7 |\n| SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s | 16 | 63 | 7 | 128-bit PQ | 32 | 64 | **7,856** | ~123\u00d7 |\n| SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128f | 16 | 66 | 22 | 128-bit PQ | 32 | 64 | **17,088** | ~267\u00d7 |\n| SLH-DSA-SHA2-192s | 24 | 63 | 7 | 192-bit PQ | 48 | 96 | **16,224** | ~254\u00d7 |\n| SLH-DSA-SHA2-192f | 24 | 66 | 22 | 192-bit PQ | 48 | 96 | **35,664** | ~557\u00d7 |\n| SLH-DSA-SHAKE-192s | 24 | 63 | 7 | 192-bit PQ | 48 | 96 | **16,224** | ~254\u00d7 |\n| SLH-DSA-SHAKE-192f | 24 | 66 | 22 | 192-bit PQ | 48 | 96 | **35,664** | ~557\u00d7 |\n| SLH-DSA-SHA2-256s | 32 | 64 | 8 | 256-bit PQ | 64 | 128 | **29,792** | ~465\u00d7 |\n| SLH-DSA-SHA2-256f | 32 | 68 | 17 | 256-bit PQ | 64 | 128 | **49,856** | ~779\u00d7 |\n| SLH-DSA-SHAKE-256s | 32 | 64 | 8 | 256-bit PQ | 64 | 128 | **29,792** | ~465\u00d7 |\n| SLH-DSA-SHAKE-256f | 32 | 68 | 17 | 256-bit PQ | 64 | 128 | **49,856** | ~779\u00d7 |\n\n*Sources: [SPHINCS+ specification r3.1](https://sphincs.org/data/sphincs+-r3.1-specification.pdf); [DigiCert SLH-DSA overview](https://www.digicert.com/insights/post-quantum-cryptography/sphincs); [NIST CSRC smaller SLH-DSA paper](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/presentations/2025/sphincs-smaller-parameter-sets/sphincs-dang_2.2.pdf)*\n\nThe **'s' parameter sets** are optimized for small signature size at the cost of slower signing (2.2 million hash calls for 128s, taking ~0.2 seconds on a 3.1 GHz Intel Xeon). The **'f' parameter sets** sign much faster but produce signatures roughly 2\u00d7 larger. Note the public key is always tiny (32\u201364 bytes) \u2014 an advantage over lattice schemes.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Pros: Conservative Security, Statelessness, Standardization\n\n**Hash-only security assumption**: SLH-DSA's security depends solely on the preimage resistance of SHA-256 or SHAKE-256 \u2014 the same functions Bitcoin already uses for proof-of-work and transaction hashing. This means Bitcoin adopting SLH-DSA adds no new cryptographic assumptions to the system. If SHA-256 is secure (as it has proven to be for over 20 years), SLH-DSA is secure against both classical and quantum adversaries. [PostQuantum.com](https://postquantum.com/post-quantum/cryptography-pqc-nist/)\n\n**Stateless operation**: Unlike XMSS and LMS, SPHINCS+ requires no state tracking. A signing device can be restored from a seed at any time without risking key reuse. This is critical for Bitcoin hardware wallets, which users routinely restore from mnemonic phrases.\n\n**Well-studied**: SPHINCS+ (the predecessor to SLH-DSA) has been under public cryptanalysis since 2015, surviving all known attacks. [Wikipedia: SPHINCS+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPHINCS+)\n\n**Tiny public keys**: The 32\u201364 byte public keys are comparable to current ECDSA public keys, meaning UTXO set storage is not greatly affected by SLH-DSA adoption relative to lattice schemes (which have 1\u20132 KB public keys).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Cons: Large Signatures, Slow Signing, Block Space Impact\n\n**Very large signatures**: Even the smallest parameter set, SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s, produces 7,856-byte signatures \u2014 123\u00d7 larger than ECDSA's 64 bytes. The largest parameter set (256f) reaches 49,856 bytes. This is the scheme's fundamental limitation for Bitcoin. [NIST CSRC FIPS 205 page](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final)\n\n**Slow signing**: The 128s signing operation requires ~2.2 million hash calls (~0.2 seconds on modern hardware). The 's' variants with a 2^24 signing limit are 664\u00d7 slower still for the same security level. For occasional transaction signing this may be acceptable, but it is noticeable compared to ECDSA's near-instantaneous signing.\n\n**Block capacity catastrophe**: A standard Bitcoin block (4 MB weight limit with SegWit discounting) currently accommodates ~7,600 transactions with ECDSA. With SLH-DSA-128s at 7,856 bytes per signature (even with witness discounting), the same block would hold only ~100 transactions \u2014 a 98% reduction in throughput. [LinkedIn/Garima Singh analysis (Jan 2026)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/post-quantum-migration-blockchain-existential-threat-garima-singh-x9gof)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bitcoin-Specific Analysis\n\n### 6.1 Impact on Block Size and Transaction Throughput\n\nBIP-360 co-author Ethan Heilman acknowledged the problem explicitly: SLH-DSA at 256-bit security produces signatures \"123\u00d7 larger than ECDSA.\" Without mitigation, this would either:\n- Reduce block capacity to ~80\u2013100 transactions per block (from ~2,000\u20137,000 currently)\n- Require a 100\u00d7+ block size increase \u2014 a deeply contentious change Bitcoin's governance has historically resisted\n\nThe [BIP-360 research paper at bip360.org](https://bip360.org) notes that \"full quantum safety requires additional soft forks to add post-quantum signature algorithms as opcodes in Bitcoin tapscript; signatures are 10 to 100 times larger, which would slow the blockchain to a crawl unless Bitcoin implements witness discounts, larger block sizes, or zero-knowledge proofs.\"\n\nEthan Heilman estimated in [February 2026](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-dinarian-262a46239_bitcoin-may-take-7-years-to-upgrade-to-post-quantum-activity-7431056197459374080-QSnT) that migrating all UTXOs to quantum-resistant addresses would take 76 to 568 days depending on available block space \u2014 a significant practical constraint even if the algorithm itself is adopted.\n\n### 6.2 SegWit Witness Discount\n\nBitcoin's SegWit discount (witness data counted at 1/4 weight) helps but does not solve the problem. A 7,856-byte SLH-DSA-128s signature would have a witness discount weight of ~1,964 vbytes \u2014 still ~31\u00d7 the cost of a current ECDSA signature's ~16.25 vbytes.

The Ethereum Foundation's post-quantum team (led by Thomas Coratger) has a working prototype doing exactly this. [LinkedIn: Bitcoin's 7-Year Quantum Upgrade Timeline](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-dinarian-262a46239_bitcoin-may-take-7-years-to-upgrade-to-post-quantum-activity-7431056197459374080-QSnT) If adopted, STARK compression could reduce the effective on-chain footprint by 10\u00d7 or more, making SLH-DSA viable for Bitcoin block space.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Matt Corallo's OP_SPHINCS Proposal\n\nIn late 2025 and early 2026, [Matt Corallo proposed OP_SPHINCS](https://forklog.com/en/chaincode-labs-sizes-up-the-quantum-threat-to-bitcoin/) \u2014 a new Bitcoin opcode that would verify SPHINCS+ signatures in Taproot script paths. The key innovation: wallets could start embedding SPHINCS+ commitments in Taproot script leaves *immediately*, without waiting for a soft fork activation:\n\n> \"In theory wallets could start doing this now. They could say, okay, I'm gonna pick, I'm gonna go implement shrinks. I'm gonna start embedding it as a leaf on the taproot script tree. I'm never gonna reveal it.\" \u2014 Matt Corallo, [Stephan Livera Podcast SLP719 (Feb 2026)](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/719/)\n\nThe OP_SPHINCS proposal exploits Taproot's structure: the hash-based PQ key is hidden in a script path that is never revealed until needed. Under normal operations, wallets spend via Schnorr key-path (no overhead). If the quantum threat materializes, Bitcoin's community could:\n1. Activate the soft fork enabling OP_SPHINCS key-path spending in the script leaf\n2. Later disable the vulnerable Schnorr key-path\n\n[Tim Ruffing (Blockstream Research) published a formal paper](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-quantum-risk-is-real-one-solution-might-start-with-taproot) confirming that Taproot's design prevents quantum attackers from bypassing the script tree \u2014 this was a deliberate design goal of Taproot.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Summary Assessment\n\nSLH-DSA is the **most trustworthy** post-quantum signature scheme from a cryptographic assumption standpoint \u2014 and the hardest to deploy at scale on Bitcoin. Its role in the Bitcoin PQ transition is likely as:\n\n1. A **Taproot hidden fallback** (via OP_SPHINCS) embedded now with zero current cost\n2. A **long-term on-chain option** contingent on STARK compression becoming practical\n3. A **conservative hedge** against lattice scheme failures \u2014 if ML-DSA or FN-DSA are broken, SLH-DSA remains the secure path\n\n*Cross-reference: [comparison-matrix.md](comparison-matrix.md) for all scheme sizes; [crystals-dilithium.md](crystals-dilithium.md) for the lattice alternative; [other-candidates.md](other-candidates.md) for STARK compression details.*\n",

All three are FIPS-certified algorithms.  \n**Last Commit Date:** April 28, 2025  \n**Activity Level:** Active (most recent substantive code changes April 2025; BIP itself merged into Bitcoin BIPs repo February 2026)  \n**Stars / Forks:** 15 stars / 2 forks  \n**License:** MIT  \n**Description:** libbitcoinpqc provides a clean, unified C API for all three BIP-360 signature algorithms, with safe Rust bindings that enforce memory safety and zero-copy operations. The library ships with Node.js TypeScript bindings (npm package `@jbride/bitcoinpqc`) and Python bindings for cross-language use. User-provided entropy is required \u2014 the library intentionally ships no random number generator \u2014 enforcing that callers supply entropy from a secure platform source. All signatures are deterministic given the message and secret key. The implementations are based on reference code from the NIST PQC standardization process and are not yet production-hardened; the README explicitly warns against production deployment.

The spec introduces SegWit v2 outputs that commit only to a Merkle root of the script tree, removing the quantum-vulnerable Taproot key-path spend. It does not yet introduce PQ signature opcodes (that is deferred to follow-on BIPs) but creates the output type infrastructure needed to use them.  \n**Last Commit / Activity:** BIP merged into official `bitcoin/bips` repository, February 2026. Active development.  \n**Stars / Forks:** The main cryptoquick/bips fork is a personal working repo; the PR on bitcoin/bips has attracted extensive community review (60+ comments).  \n**License:** Follows Bitcoin BIPs conventions (public domain / CC0)  \n**Description:** The BIP-360 specification has undergone several substantial rewrites since its initial publication in September 2024. The December 2025 rewrite by Hunter Beast and Ethan Heilman, with editorial work from Isabel Foxen Duke, produced the version that was merged in February 2026. The current specification removes SQIsign (15,000\u00d7 slower verification than ECC \u2014 a 4-hour block validation time for a full SQIsign block) and prioritizes ML-DSA-44, SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s, and FN-DSA-512 as FIPS-compliant candidates.

The primary activity is at the BIP specification layer:\n\n- **BIP-360 PR #1670** on `bitcoin/bips` \u2014 merged February 2026. Specifies P2MR output type. No accompanying Bitcoin Core implementation PR.\n- **BIP Draft: Quantum Migration (#1895)** on `bitcoin/bips` \u2014 opened July 2025 by @jlopp, proposing migration mechanics.

Cross-references: `../04-signature-schemes/comparison-matrix.md`, `../03-proposals-and-bips/`.*\n\n---\n\n## The Core Tension\n\nBitcoin's quantum resistance engineering problem is unique in distributed systems: every technical change must achieve global consensus among thousands of independently operated nodes, with no central authority to mandate upgrades. Historical precedent is sobering \u2014 SegWit required approximately 8.5 years from conception to widespread adoption, Taproot approximately 7.5 years. Ethan Heilman's 2026 analysis estimates a [seven-year minimum timeline for full quantum hardening](https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/7e26b-bitcoin-quantum-threat-timeline-research) \u2014 and that assumes \"full cooperation and agreement,\" which has never characterized Bitcoin governance on contentious changes.\n\nThe engineering challenges are simultaneously cryptographic, economic, and political.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Block Size and Transaction Size Impact\n\n### The Raw Numbers\n\nPost-quantum signatures are dramatically larger than Bitcoin's current cryptographic overhead. The [Chaincode Labs analysis](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) provides the definitive comparison:\n\n| Algorithm | Signature Size | vs. Schnorr (64B) | Public Key | vs. secp256k1 (32B) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Schnorr (current) | 64 bytes | 1\u00d7 | 32 bytes | 1\u00d7 |\n| FN-DSA-512 (FALCON) | ~666 bytes avg. | **10\u00d7** | 897 bytes | **28\u00d7** |\n| ML-DSA-44 (Dilithium) | 2,420 bytes | **38\u00d7** | 1,312 bytes | **41\u00d7** |\n| SLH-DSA-128s (SPHINCS+) | 7,856 bytes | **~123\u00d7** | 32 bytes | 1\u00d7 |\n| SLH-DSA-128f (fast variant) | 17,088 bytes | **267\u00d7** | 32 bytes | 1\u00d7 |\n\nA typical 1-input-2-output P2WPKH transaction is approximately 140 vbytes. Replacing the 64-byte Schnorr signature and 32-byte pubkey with ML-DSA-44 data adds ~3,666 bytes \u2014 inflating the transaction to ~3,800 bytes, a **27\u00d7 increase**. With SPHINCS+ (128s), the same transaction balloons to ~8,000 bytes \u2014 a **57\u00d7 increase**.\n\n### Block Capacity Effects\n\nBitcoin's 4 MB weight limit (effective ~1\u20132 MB of data per block) translates roughly to:\n\n- **Current**: ~2,500\u20133,000 P2WPKH transactions per block\n- **With ML-DSA (no discount)**: ~90\u2013130 transactions per block\n- **With SPHINCS+ (no discount)**: ~30\u201350 transactions per block\n\n[Project Eleven's analysis](https://blog.projecteleven.com/posts/a-look-at-post-quantum-proposals-for-bitcoin) confirms: *\"A single ML-DSA signature can be between 2\u20133KB. SLH-DSA signatures can be up to 8KB.\"*\n\nBTQ Technologies' testnet chose the only currently practical mitigation: **a 64 MiB block size limit** \u2014 a 64\u00d7 increase from Bitcoin's current limit \u2014 to accommodate ML-DSA signatures at reasonable transaction throughput. [BTQ's January 2026 testnet announcement](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/btq-technologies-launches-bitcoin-quantum-testnet-302658425.html) explicitly states: *\"64 MiB block size limit to accommodate larger post-quantum signatures (ML-DSA signatures are approximately 38\u201372\u00d7 larger than ECDSA).\"*\n\nA 64 MiB block on mainnet would be unacceptable to the Bitcoin community for decentralization reasons \u2014 it would severely raise the hardware and bandwidth requirements for running a full node.\n\n### The Witness Discount as a Partial Solution\n\nBIP-360 proposes a \"quantum attestation discount\" analogous to SegWit's witness discount. Three discount scenarios were discussed in the [February 2025 Bitcoin Dev mailing list thread](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/oQKezDOc4us):\n\n- **QuBit16 (16\u00d7 attestation discount)**: Balances storage with partial throughput recovery; PQ transactions still significantly larger fee-wise\n- **QuBit64 (64\u00d7 attestation discount)**: Maximizes TPS recovery; approaches current transaction throughput; dramatically increases node storage requirements\n- **QuBitWit (no discount)**: Full fee exposure; PQ transactions prohibitively expensive for everyday use\n\nEven with a 64\u00d7 discount, the underlying blockchain data growth would be substantial. A full ML-DSA migration of all UTXOs at 100% block space consumption would require [76\u2013142 days of continuous processing](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf); at a more realistic 25% block space allocation, 305\u2013568 days.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Transaction Throughput Reduction\n\nWithout mitigation strategies, Bitcoin's current ~7 transactions per second would degrade severely:\n\n- **With ML-DSA-44 (no discount)**: approximately 0.2\u20130.3 tx/s\n- **With SPHINCS+ 128s (no discount)**: approximately 0.05\u20130.1 tx/s\n\nThe [Project Eleven analysis](https://blog.projecteleven.com/posts/a-look-at-post-quantum-proposals-for-bitcoin) and [Ethan Heilman's NTC proposal](https://www.ethanheilman.com/x/32/index.html) offer the most concrete mitigation path:\n\n**Non-Interactive Transaction Compression (NTC) via STARKs:**\n> *\"Consider the following back of the envelope math: 2 bytes per Input = 2 bytes per TXID, 0 bytes per signature; 37 bytes per output = 32 bytes pubkey hash + 5 bytes value. A 1-input-2-output transaction would be 76 bytes. (4,000,000/76)/(60\u00d710) = ~87 tx/s.\"*\n\nThis approach \u2014 having miners non-interactively aggregate all PQ signatures in a block into a single STARK proof, then stripping individual signatures from block data \u2014 could actually **increase Bitcoin's throughput from ~7 tx/s to ~87 tx/s**, even after the PQ transition. With pre-block coinjoins and aggregation strategies, further gains are theorized. The STARK itself would be treated as \"free\" in block weight to incentivize adoption.\n\nThe same analysis notes a critical distinction: *\"Paying becomes cheap; storing junk [NFTs, arbitrary data] stays expensive\"* \u2014 because STARKs only compress valid payment signatures, not arbitrary data.\n\nHowever, NTC via STARKs is **speculative research** requiring significant engineering work, community debate on ZK in Bitcoin, and choice of PQ signature schemes that support non-interactive aggregation (such as LaBRADOR).\n\n[Source: Ethan Heilman's blog, April 2025](https://www.ethanheilman.com/x/32/index.html)  \n[Source: Bitcoin Dev mailing list, NTC discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/wKizvPUfO7w)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Wallet Complexity and Key Derivation\n\n### BIP-32 xpub Incompatibility\n\nThe most technically acute wallet challenge identified in BIP-360 development is **BIP-32 incompatibility**. Noted by developer @conduition in [mailing list discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/oQKezDOc4us): current HD wallet xpub generation relies on elliptic curve key tweaking (adding child derivation offsets to the parent key). PQ algorithms like ML-DSA and SPHINCS+ are not algebraically structured in a way that supports this tweak.\n\nConsequences:\n- Watch-only wallets that use xpubs cannot trivially generate child addresses for PQ key pairs\n- Cold storage setups with offline signing using xpubs for address generation require redesign\n- Hardware wallets exporting xpubs for watch-only use must find an entirely new derivation scheme\n\nThe [Human Rights Foundation report](https://hrf.org/latest/the-quantum-threat-to-bitcoin/) summarizes: *\"Quantum-resistant algorithms would likely introduce much larger signature sizes, slower signing speeds, and more complex verification paths. These are not minor tweaks; they fundamentally change how Bitcoin wallets must operate.\"*\n\n### m-of-n Multisig Specification\n\nHunter Beast explicitly identified m/n multisig as *\"the single largest obvious omission in the spec right now\"* in his [February 2025 mailing list update](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/oQKezDOc4us). BIP-360's current design supports n/n multisig via Merkle tree key commitments but has no specified threshold mechanism. Proposals involve encoding threshold parameters in additional bytes of the SegWit v3 output, but this remains unresolved.\n\n### Key Backup and Recovery Complexity\n\nStateless hash-based schemes (SPHINCS+/SLH-DSA) carry no key-reuse state \u2014 each signature is independent. Lattice-based schemes (ML-DSA, FALCON) have more compact signatures but require careful entropy handling. The Ledger Nano S's [320 KB Flash / 10 KB RAM constraints](https://www.ledger.com/blog/should-crypto-fear-quantum-computing) make storing and computing PQ keys on existing hardware wallets challenging or impossible in their current form.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hardware Wallet Storage and Compute Constraints\n\nHardware wallets represent the most constrained execution environment for PQ cryptography. [Ledger's CTO Charles Guillemet](https://u.today/quantum-computing-risk-to-cryptos-ledger-cto-flags-key-vulnerability) confirmed on February 27, 2026 that Ledger's PQ experiments inside Secure Elements run entirely in **software-only mode, without hardware acceleration**:\n\n> *\"RAM pressure and compute cost remain major bottlenecks.\"*\n\nSpecific constraints:\n- **Ledger Nano S**: 320 KB Flash, 10 KB RAM \u2014 [insufficient for Rainbow-class signatures](https://www.ledger.com/blog/should-crypto-fear-quantum-computing); ML-DSA-44's 2,560-byte secret key alone fits in RAM, but signing operations require additional working memory\n- **Signing latency**: ML-DSA-44 signs at ~8\u00d7 the cost of ECDSA; SPHINCS+ signs at 5,700\u2013111,000\u00d7 the cost \u2014 the latter taking **2+ seconds on a laptop** (documented in the [OpenSSH SPHINCS+ implementation blog](https://blog.josefsson.org/2024/12/23/openssh-and-git-on-a-post-quantum-sphincs/))\n- **Trezor Safe 7**: Uses SLH-DSA-128 for internal firmware verification only; Bitcoin signing remains classical\n\nThe TROPIC01 secure chip in Trezor Safe 7 demonstrates the hardware architecture direction \u2014 auditable secure elements with algorithmic agility \u2014 but current Secure Elements are not designed for PQ signing workloads. The Ledger blog notes: *\"We expect hardware to adapt quickly to the need for post-quantum algorithm-friendly hardware and remove that memory (or sometimes performance) all together in time\"* \u2014 a statement of optimism, not a timeline.\n\n[Source: Ledger CTO February 2026](https://u.today/quantum-computing-risk-to-cryptos-ledger-cto-flags-key-vulnerability)  \n[Source: Trezor Safe 7](https://trezor.io/trezor-safe-7)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Initial Block Download (IBD) Impact\n\nIBD is the process by which new full nodes download and verify the entire blockchain history. Currently, a full Bitcoin IBD transfers approximately 600 GB of data and can take days on consumer hardware.\n\nA post-quantum Bitcoin with ML-DSA signatures and no block size change would see per-block data balloon by 27\u201357\u00d7 for PQ transactions. Even with a witness discount that keeps fee economics manageable, the raw bandwidth and storage required for IBD would increase substantially:\n\n- **Current blockchain size**: ~600 GB\n- **Post-migration estimate (ML-DSA, 25% block space, no STARK compression)**: an additional 1.2\u20132.4 TB for the post-fork history\n- **With STARK/NTC aggregation**: compressed blocks could actually reduce IBD data burden below today's level\n\nAn important near-term challenge is that the **AssumeValid** optimization in Bitcoin Core (which skips signature verification for blocks before a known-good checkpoint) would require extension to handle PQ signatures during IBD. New nodes bootstrapping after a PQ transition would need to verify both classical and PQ signatures across the historical chain until the AssumeValid checkpoint is updated \u2014 doubling verification workload during the migration period.\n\nThe [QRL's \"Downtime Required for Bitcoin Quantum Safety\" paper](https://www.theqrl.org/blog/preparing-bitcoin-for-the-postquantum-era-insights-from-quantum-computing-experts/) calculated that a full UTXO set migration at 100% block space dedication would require at minimum **76.16 days of continuous processing time** \u2014 a lower bound that does not account for real-world network overhead or competing transactions.\n\n---\n\n## 6. UTXO Set Implications\n\nThe Bitcoin UTXO set (~5\u20136 GB today) stores the locked output of every unspent transaction. Post-quantum output types add new scriptPubKey patterns. Key concerns:\n\n- **P2MR outputs** (BIP-360): Commits to the Merkle root of a script tree; witness program is 32 bytes \u2014 same size as Taproot. **No UTXO set bloat** from P2MR itself.\n- **PQ signature data in witness**: Witness data is discounted under SegWit but still affects chain growth\n- **Migration UTXOs**: If a future BIP enables migration of vulnerable P2PK/P2PKH/P2TR UTXOs, a temporary surge in UTXO creation (new quantum-safe outputs) and destruction (old vulnerable outputs) could spike UTXO set memory usage during the migration window\n- **xpub-derived addresses**: A CRQC that derives child keys from an exposed xpub+chaincode pair could preemptively sweep derived addresses before owners migrate \u2014 affecting a non-trivial portion of the UTXO set\n\n---\n\n## 7. Mempool Considerations\n\nBitcoin's mempool is the holding area where transactions wait for block inclusion. The mempool window creates a **short-exposure attack surface**: once a spending transaction is broadcast, the public key is visible to quantum attackers for approximately 10 minutes before confirmation.\n\nBIP-360 (P2MR) addresses the **long-exposure** attack (where the public key is permanently visible on-chain) but explicitly does not address short-exposure attacks. [Forbes (February 2026)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/) notes: *\"BIP 360 does not address the short-exposure attack: the risk that a computer could derive a private key from a key during the brief period a transaction remains in the mempool before confirmation.\"*\n\nShort-exposure attack mitigations require:\n- Post-quantum signature schemes (deferred to follow-on BIPs after BIP-360)\n- **Private mempools** (e.g., MARA Slipstream) that submit transactions directly to miners without public mempool broadcast. [MARA's analysis](https://www.mara.com/posts/bitcoin-and-quantum) identifies private mempools as potentially essential infrastructure for the quantum migration period.\n- Commit-reveal schemes (proposed by Ethan Heilman) that hash the transaction ID + public key before revealing\n\nMempool management also becomes more complex with large PQ transactions \u2014 a SPHINCS+ transaction at 8+ KB is 60\u00d7 the size of a typical P2WPKH transaction, affecting mempool sizing, eviction policies, and fee estimation algorithms.\n\n---\n\n## 8. SPV / Light Client Impact\n\nSimple Payment Verification (SPV) clients (including most mobile wallets) verify only block headers and Merkle proofs for specific transactions. They do not validate signatures. For SPV clients:\n\n- **The good news**: SPV clients do not need to download or verify PQ signatures \u2014 they trust the mining network to enforce signature validity\n- **The bad news**: SPV security is weakened by the PQ migration period; an attacker with a CRQC who can forge signatures would fool SPV clients until they receive a block header from an honest chain\n\nMore practically, SPV clients must update to:\n- Recognize new output types (P2MR, future SegWit v3)\n- Handle new address formats (the current BIP-360 spec's \"bc1r\" prefix for P2MR)\n- Compute Merkle proofs against the new witness structure\n\nThe wallet ecosystem upgrade challenge is significant. [Forbes (February 2026)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/) estimates the full upgrade cycle \u2014 from BIP finalization through wallet, exchange, and custody software updates \u2014 as \"several additional years\" beyond consensus activation.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Witness Discount Economics: Current SegWit vs. PQ Signatures\n\nBitcoin's witness data receives a 75% discount in block weight calculation under SegWit (1 WU per byte vs. 4 WU per byte for non-witness data). This discount exists because witness data does not need to be stored in the UTXO set and is less critical for the spendability of outputs.\n\nUnder the current witness discount regime applied to ML-DSA-44 data:\n\n- ML-DSA-44 signature (2,420 bytes \u00d7 1 WU/byte = 2,420 WU)\n- vs. Schnorr signature (64 bytes \u00d7 1 WU/byte = 64 WU)\n- **Effective cost ratio: ~38\u00d7** even with the existing discount\n\nBIP-360 proposes an additional \"attestation discount\" for PQ data specifically. The [Bitcoin Dev mailing list discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/oQKezDOc4us) modeled three scenarios:\n- **QuBit16**: 16\u00d7 additional discount \u2192 PQ tx cost ~2.4\u00d7 current Schnorr tx\n- **QuBit64**: 64\u00d7 additional discount \u2192 PQ tx cost comparable to current Schnorr tx\n\nA QuBit64 discount would, however, make PQ signature data extremely cheap relative to its actual bandwidth/storage cost to nodes \u2014 creating potential for data-stuffing attacks where PQ signature fields are used as a cheap data channel. Ethan Heilman's NTC-via-STARKs proposal addresses this by making the STARK proof \"free\" rather than discounting raw signature bytes, thereby preventing the data-stuffing exploit (JPEGs don't compress through a STARK; only valid payment signatures do).\n\n---\n\n## 10. STARK / Aggregation as a Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Non-Interactive Transaction Compression (NTC) / Non-Interactive Witness Aggregation (NIWA)**, proposed by Ethan Heilman in [April 2025](https://www.ethanheilman.com/x/32/index.html) and discussed on the [Bitcoin Dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/wKizvPUfO7w), remains the most technically ambitious mitigation:\n\n**Mechanism**: The block miner pulls out all PQ signatures from all transactions in the block, aggregates them into a single STARK proof, and replaces the individual signatures with the proof. Individual transactions in the chain contain only 2-byte TXIDs and no signatures. The STARK proves that all signatures were valid.\n\n**Claimed benefits**:\n- Throughput: ~7 tx/s \u2192 ~87 tx/s (possibly higher with coinjoin pre-aggregation)\n- Fee structure inversion: payments become *cheaper* than data storage (because data doesn't get STARK-compressed)\n- Privacy: block-wide coinjoins become default behavior\n- Node storage: compressed blocks potentially smaller than today's blocks\n\n**Engineering blockers**:\n- Requires PQ signature schemes supporting non-interactive aggregation (LaBRADOR is proposed; standardization incomplete)\n- STARK proof generation is computationally expensive \u2014 miners bear this cost\n- Requires new transaction format support across all nodes\n- Community debate on ZK proofs in Bitcoin consensus is likely to be contentious\n- Bootstrapping problem: wallets and exchanges won't invest in new format if no one uses it; NTC proposes treating the STARK as \"free\" in block weight to solve the chicken-and-egg problem\n\nAs Heilman notes, NTC is a stepping stone: *\"None of this is an argument against adopting BIP-360 or other PQ signature schemes into Bitcoin. On the contrary, having PQ signatures in Bitcoin would be a useful stepping stone to PQ transaction compression since it would allow us to gain agreement on which PQ signature schemes to build on.\"*\n\n[Source: Ethan Heilman's blog](https://www.ethanheilman.com/x/32/index.html)  \n[Source: Project Eleven post-quantum analysis](https://blog.projecteleven.com/posts/a-look-at-post-quantum-proposals-for-bitcoin)\n\n---\n\n## 11. Testing and Review Timeline\n\n[Forbes (February 2026)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/) summarizes the Heilman timeline framework: *\"Achieving full quantum resistance for Bitcoin, assuming immediate action and agreement, would likely take about seven years: three years to finalize BIPs, complete code reviews and testing, and secure community consensus; six months for activation; and several additional years for wallets, custodians, exchanges, network nodes, and enterprise treasury software to upgrade.\"*\n\nThe milestone path:\n\n| Phase | Duration | Activities |\n|---|---|---|\n| BIP finalization | 12\u201324 months | Spec review, test vectors, mailing list consensus, reference implementation |\n| Bitcoin Core implementation | 12\u201318 months | Code review, test coverage, security audit, multiple rounds of developer feedback |\n| Activation signaling | 6\u201312 months | Miner signaling (Taproot-style), node upgrade adoption threshold |\n| Ecosystem upgrades | 2\u20135 years | Wallets, exchanges, hardware wallets, custody software, payment processors |\n| Full UTXO migration | 1\u20133 years | Optional migration period; coercion vs. voluntary depends on governance decisions |\n\n**Current status** (February 2026): BIP-360 merged into the BIP repository, but no Bitcoin Core implementation PR has been opened. The [Chaincode Labs May 2025 paper](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) concluded that all Bitcoin PQ initiatives \"remain at an early and exploratory stage.\" Active dissent from prominent developers (Luke Dashjr: *\"Quantum isn't a real threat. Bitcoin has much bigger problems to address\"*; Adam Back of Blockstream arguing the threat is *\"still decades away\"*) means community consensus on urgency \u2014 let alone technical approach \u2014 remains unachieved.\n\n---\n\n## 12. The Algorithm Selection Problem\n\nBIP-360 currently proposes three algorithms simultaneously (ML-DSA-44, SLH-DSA-Shake-128s, FN-DSA-512). This creates its own engineering complexity:\n\n- Bitcoin Core must implement, test, and maintain three separate cryptographic code paths\n- Wallets must support algorithm selection UI and storage\n- Each algorithm adds attack surface; a break in one requires urgent response\n- FALCON's standardization status is uncertain (NIST has not finalized FN-DSA yet as of late 2025)\n- Bitcoin Optech contributor Murch raised the concern that *\"introducing four new algorithms into the network was too many \u2014 adding too much complexity\"*\n\nThe counterargument (Hunter Beast): No single algorithm is guaranteed to remain quantum-resistant indefinitely; post-quantum cryptography is newer and less battle-tested than ECC. Redundancy provides defense-in-depth. A 2022 incident where one NIST PQC competition submission was broken on a consumer laptop in 53 hours (noted by [DL News](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/web3/bitcoin-needs-to-upgrade-to-post-quantum-cryptography/)) underscores the risk of single-algorithm commitment.\n\n---\n\n*Cross-reference: `./active-repos.md` for code implementation status, `./proof-of-concepts.md` for demonstrated capabilities, `../04-signature-schemes/comparison-matrix.md` for detailed algorithm comparisons, `../03-proposals-and-bips/` for BIP-360 specification details.*\n",

All other work remains at the specification and prototype library stage. No post-quantum transaction has ever been confirmed on Bitcoin mainnet.\n\n---\n\n## 1. BTQ Technologies Bitcoin Quantum Testnet\n\n### What It Is\nThe Bitcoin Quantum testnet, launched January 12, 2026 by BTQ Technologies Corp. (Nasdaq: BTQ), is the first open, permissionless quantum-safe fork of Bitcoin to run as a live network. It replaces Bitcoin's ECDSA signatures with ML-DSA (Module-Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm, FIPS 204 / formerly CRYSTALS-Dilithium), the same standard mandated by the U.S. NSA for national security systems.\n\nThe launch date \u2014 January 12, 2026 \u2014 was deliberately chosen as the 17th anniversary of Satoshi Nakamoto mining Bitcoin's genesis block. According to BTQ's [PR Newswire announcement](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/btq-technologies-launches-bitcoin-quantum-testnet-302658425.html), the tagline was: *\"Seventeen years ago, Bitcoin introduced a new paradigm for digital value. Today, we're launching the testnet that will help ensure Bitcoin's security model survives the quantum era.\"*\n\n### Technical Specifications\n\n| Parameter | Bitcoin Mainnet | Bitcoin Quantum Testnet |\n|---|---|---|\n| Signature algorithm | ECDSA / Schnorr | ML-DSA (FIPS 204) |\n| Signature size | 64\u201372 bytes | ~2,420 bytes (38\u201372\u00d7 larger) |\n| Block size limit | 1\u20134 MB (SegWit) | **64 MiB** |\n| Post-quantum security level | None | 128-bit PQ (NIST Level 2) |\n| Genesis block | Jan 3, 2009 | Jan 12, 2026 |\n| Infrastructure | Bitcoin Core base | Bitcoin Core fork |\n\nThe 64 MiB block size was a **necessary engineering change** to accommodate ML-DSA signatures, which are approximately 38\u201372\u00d7 larger than ECDSA. Without this accommodation, the current Bitcoin 4 MB SegWit block limit would allow fewer than 1,500 ML-DSA transactions per block (vs. ~2,500\u20133,000 typical P2WPKH transactions today).\n\n### What Was Demonstrated\nThe testnet infrastructure includes a public block explorer at `explorer.bitcoinquantum.com` and a mining pool at `pool.bitcoinquantum.com`. Verified capabilities include:\n\n- **Wallet creation** with ML-DSA key pairs\n- **Transaction signing** using ML-DSA replacing all ECDSA paths\n- **Transaction verification** by full nodes\n- **Block mining** under the modified consensus rules\n- **Full transaction lifecycle** from wallet to confirmed block under quantum-resistant cryptography\n\nThe open, permissionless design invites miners, developers, and researchers to run nodes, mine blocks, send transactions, and attempt to find vulnerabilities before any potential mainnet migration.\n\n### Research Validation\nDelphi Digital's December 2025 report *\"BTQ Technologies: Securing Crypto's Future Against the Quantum Threat\"* described Bitcoin Quantum as a **\"quantum canary\" network** \u2014 a production-grade testbed enabling the crypto ecosystem to battle-test quantum-resistant solutions without risking Bitcoin mainnet. The report flagged approximately 6.65 million BTC as immediately attackable due to permanently exposed public keys, including Satoshi Nakamoto's estimated holdings of 600,000\u20131.1 million BTC.\n\n[Source: Investing.com, January 2026](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bitcoin-quantum-testnet-launches-as-first-quantumsafe-bitcoin-fork-93CH-4441742)  \n[Source: ForkLog, January 2026](https://forklog.com/en/btq-launches-quantum-resistant-bitcoin-testnet/)  \n[Source: PR Newswire, January 2026](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/btq-technologies-launches-bitcoin-quantum-testnet-302658425.html)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Bitcoin Quantum Core Release 0.2 (October 2025 Demonstration)\n\n### What It Is\nOn October 16, 2025, BTQ Technologies published a [SEC exhibit filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1821866/000127956925001122/ex991.htm) announcing the first successful demonstration of a NIST-compliant quantum-resistant Bitcoin implementation. This predated the January 2026 public testnet launch and represented an internal proof-of-concept with mainnet and testnet genesis blocks mined.\n\n### What Was Demonstrated\n- Complete replacement of ECDSA with ML-DSA (FIPS 204) \u2014 the same algorithm the U.S. government mandated for national security systems\n- A full transaction lifecycle: key generation \u2192 wallet \u2192 signing \u2192 verification \u2192 mining\n- New genesis blocks mined for both mainnet and testnet configurations\n- Script and block size consensus modifications to 64 MiB\n\n### Benchmark Context\nBTQ also disclosed that through its acquisition of Radical Semiconductor, it developed **CASH (Cryptographically Agile Secure Hardware)** achieving up to **1 million post-quantum signatures per second** in hardware. This benchmark is the most significant PQ signing throughput number disclosed for Bitcoin-context implementations. At this rate, a mining pool could theoretically sign and verify at sufficient volume for production-scale Bitcoin transaction processing \u2014 though this requires dedicated ML-DSA hardware, not software running on standard node hardware.\n\n[Source: SEC Exhibit 99.1, October 2025](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1821866/000127956925001122/ex991.htm)\n\n---\n\n## 3. BIP-360 Test Vectors (Python and Rust)\n\n### What It Is\nIn December 2025, the BIP-360 authors published test vectors in both Python and Rust as part of the clean-sheet rewrite of the BIP specification. These test vectors demonstrate correct P2MR output construction, script-tree Merkle root computation, and witness validation for the new SegWit v2 output type.\n\n### What Was Demonstrated\n- P2MR scriptPubKey construction: a SegWit v2 output committing to the Merkle root of the script tree\n- Control block construction (1 + 32m bytes, vs. Taproot's 33 + 32m bytes)\n- Correct witness stack validation for the P2MR script path\n- Compatibility with BIP 341 (Taproot) Merkle tree computation while removing the key path\n\nTest vectors are modeled after Steven Roose's BIP-346 work. A specific test demonstrates a tapscript requiring a secp256k1 signature to spend a P2MR UTXO, modeled after BIP 341 examples. Signatures use an all-zero `0x0000...0000` BIP 340 auxiliary randomness array.\n\n**These test vectors do NOT yet include PQ signatures** \u2014 they test the output type structure only. Post-quantum signature opcodes are deferred to future BIPs.\n\n[Source: BIP360.org specification](https://bip360.org/bip360.html)  \n[Source: Delving Bitcoin: Major BIP 360 Update](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/major-bip-360-update/2170)\n\n---\n\n## 4. libbitcoinpqc API Demonstration\n\n### What It Is\nThe [libbitcoinpqc repository](https://github.com/cryptoquick/libbitcoinpqc) ships working reference code demonstrating all three BIP-360 signature algorithms end-to-end: key generation, signing, and verification across ML-DSA-44, SLH-DSA-Shake-128s, and FN-DSA-512.\n\n### Benchmark Data (from libbitcoinpqc README)\n\n| Algorithm | Public Key | Secret Key | Signature | Security Level |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| secp256k1 | 32 bytes | 32 bytes | 64 bytes | Classical |\n| FN-DSA-512 (FALCON) | 897 bytes | 1,281 bytes | ~666 bytes avg. | NIST Level 1 |\n| ML-DSA-44 (Dilithium) | 1,312 bytes | 2,560 bytes | 2,420 bytes | NIST Level 2 |\n| SLH-DSA-Shake-128s (SPHINCS+) | 32 bytes | 64 bytes | 7,856 bytes | NIST Level 1 |\n\n### From Chaincode Labs Analysis (Comprehensive Benchmark)\n\nThe [Chaincode Labs paper](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) published the most systematic benchmark comparison:\n\n| Algorithm | Pubkey vs Schnorr | Sig vs Schnorr | Sign Cost vs ECDSA | Verify Cost vs ECDSA |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Schnorr (baseline) | 1.0\u00d7 | 1.0\u00d7 | 1.0\u00d7 | 1.0\u00d7 |\n| Lamport | 512\u00d7 | 117\u00d7 | ~0.3\u00d7 | ~5\u00d7 |\n| XMSS | 2.1\u00d7 | 38\u00d7 | ~30\u00d7 | ~50\u00d7 |\n| SPHINCS+ 128s (small) | 1.0\u00d7 | 122\u00d7 | ~111,000\u00d7 | ~37\u00d7 |\n| SPHINCS+ 128f (fast) | 1.0\u00d7 | 267\u00d7 | ~5,700\u00d7 | ~99\u00d7 |\n| ML-DSA-44 (Dilithium) | 41\u00d7 | 38\u00d7 | ~8\u00d7 | ~0.9\u00d7 |\n| FN-DSA-512 (FALCON) | 28\u00d7 | 10\u00d7 | ~24\u00d7 | ~0.6\u00d7 |\n| SQIsign I | 2\u00d7 | 2.8\u00d7 | ~135,000\u00d7 | ~830\u00d7 |\n\nFALCON verification at 0.6\u00d7 ECDSA (faster) and Dilithium verification at 0.9\u00d7 ECDSA (near-parity) are encouraging for full-node operations. Signing latency is the primary user-facing concern.\n\n[Source: Chaincode Labs PDF](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf)\n\n---\n\n## 5. OP_CAT Lamport Signature Proof-of-Concept\n\n### What It Is\nJeremy Rubin demonstrated that OP_CAT enables Lamport OTS verification in Bitcoin Script. Ethan Heilman's [OP_CAT draft BIP](https://github.com/EthanHeilman/op_cat_draft/blob/main/cat.mediawiki) includes detailed script code showing how 20-byte Lamport signature verification can be encoded in Tapscript using OP_CAT and OP_HASH160 chains. A 2023 [Delving Bitcoin post by @moonsettler](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/lamport-signatures-and-other-cat-tricks/236) documented the full script construction.\n\n### What It Demonstrates\n- Lamport OTS verification requires only OP_CAT + OP_HASH160 \u2014 no new opcodes\n- A single Lamport verification over a 256-bit sighash produces a working Bitcoin transaction\n- The script is approximately 256 \u00d7 9 = 2,304 opcodes in length for a full sighash check\n- Blockstream's [Jonas Nick blog post](https://blog.blockstream.com/script-state-from-lamport-signatures/) showed how the same construction enables \"script state\" \u2014 a key-value store accessible across transactions\n\n### Limitations of This Approach\nAs noted by Hunter Beast in [a 2025 Bitcoin Magazine interview](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/18985680876554): *\"OP_CAT can be used to implement post-quantum cryptography on Bitcoin, but it would be horribly inefficient from a transaction size perspective.\"* A single Lamport signature verification requires ~16 KB of script data, compared to 64 bytes for a Schnorr signature.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Project Eleven Q-Day Prize\n\n### What It Is\n[Project Eleven](https://blog.projecteleven.com/posts/a-look-at-post-quantum-proposals-for-bitcoin), a quantum computing research organization, launched the **Q-Day Prize** in April 2025: a global challenge offering **1 BTC** to the first team able to break an elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC) key using Shor's algorithm on a quantum computer.\n\n### Rules\n- Deadline: **April 5, 2026**\n- Target: Break ECC keys ranging from **1 to 25 bits** \u2014 a scaled-down version of Bitcoin's 256-bit curve\n- Requirement: Must implement **Shor's algorithm on actual quantum hardware** (no classical computation shortcuts)\n- Documentation required: Gate-level circuit code or runnable instructions, plus methodology narrative\n- Registration at: [QDayPrize.org](https://qdayprize.org)\n\n### Significance and Design\nThe challenge was explicitly designed to benchmark quantum computing progress against cryptography \u2014 not to break Bitcoin, but to provide a measurable empirical data point. Alex Pruden, CEO of Project Eleven, stated: *\"We have no clear idea how close we are to a quantum 'doomsday' scenario for existing cryptography. The Q-Day Prize is designed to take a theoretical threat from a quantum computer, and turn that into a concrete model.\"*\n\nThe bounty is structured so that even a successful 5-bit key crack \"would indicate that quantum computing is advancing faster than anticipated.\" The progression logic follows the RSA Factoring Challenge model from 1991.\n\n### Status as of February 2026\nThe prize remains unclaimed as of the research date. No team has publicly reported cracking even a 5-bit elliptic curve key with Shor's algorithm on actual quantum hardware. IBM, Google, IonQ, and QuEra \u2014 the major cloud quantum providers offering access for testing \u2014 have not demonstrated the circuit depth and qubit coherence required to execute Shor's algorithm against even small ECC keys.\n\nThe challenge closes April 5, 2026.\n\n[Source: Bitcoin Magazine / Nasdaq, April 2025](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/project-eleven-to-award-1-btc-to-tackle-bitcoins-quantum-vulnerability)  \n[Source: AInvest, April 2025](https://www.ainvest.com/news/project-eleven-offers-85-000-bounty-test-quantum-threat-bitcoin-2504/)\n\n---\n\n## 7. Trezor Safe 7 \u2014 Hardware Wallet Quantum-Ready Architecture\n\n### What It Is\nThe [Trezor Safe 7](https://trezor.io/trezor-safe-7-bitcoin-only), announced October 2025 and shipping November 23, 2025, is marketed as \"the first quantum-ready hardware wallet.\" It uses the TROPIC01 secure element chip \u2014 the first auditable, open-to-inspection Secure Element \u2014 and implements **SLH-DSA-128** (SPHINCS+ in FIPS form) to secure firmware updates, device authentication, and the boot process.\n\n### What \"Quantum-Ready\" Means in Practice\nTrezor's documentation is explicit that this does not change how Bitcoin or any other network validates transactions today. The quantum-ready label refers specifically to:\n- **Firmware update verification** using SLH-DSA-128 instead of classical ECDSA\n- **Device attestation** secured against quantum attackers who might try to forge a firmware signature\n- **Boot chain integrity** verified with post-quantum signatures\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum transactions themselves continue to use ECDSA/Schnorr \u2014 unchanged \u2014 as no network-level PQ upgrade exists yet. The device is designed to accept post-quantum firmware updates without hardware replacement when blockchain-level upgrades arrive.\n\n### Technical Implementation\nLedger's CTO Charles Guillemet confirmed in a [February 27, 2026 disclosure](https://u.today/quantum-computing-risk-to-cryptos-ledger-cto-flags-key-vulnerability) that Ledger runs PQ experiments inside Secure Elements in **software-only mode, without hardware acceleration**, with RAM pressure and compute cost as the primary bottlenecks. This confirms that production hardware signers for full PQ Bitcoin signing remain a future engineering challenge.\n\n[Source: Trezor Safe 7 Product Page](https://trezor.io/trezor-safe-7-bitcoin-only)  \n[Source: CryptoSlate, October 2025](https://cryptoslate.com/what-trezors-new-quantum-ready-hardware-wallet-really-means-for-bitcoin/)  \n[Source: Ledger Blog, February 2023](https://www.ledger.com/blog/should-crypto-fear-quantum-computing)\n\n---\n\n## Conference Demonstrations\n\n### MIT Bitcoin Expo 2025\nHunter Beast presented BIP-360 at the [MIT Bitcoin Expo 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NoJnPmCVdU), explaining the P2QRH architecture and quantum threat timeline. He noted that Surmount Systems is targeting \"a sort of implementation and test net for quantum resistance available by the end of the year [2025]\" \u2014 a goal realized by BTQ Technologies in January 2026 if not by Surmount directly.\n\n### Presidio Bitcoin Quantum Summit (2025)\nThe Human Rights Foundation convened a six-month expert discussion process culminating in a [comprehensive report published October 2025](https://hrf.org/latest/the-quantum-threat-to-bitcoin/). The summit gathered Bitcoin developers, cryptographers, and quantum computing researchers to assess the threat and coordinate responses.

  "06-people-and-orgs/debate-map": "# Bitcoin Quantum Resistance: Debate Map\n\n*Phase 3 \u2014 Key People & Organizations | Last updated: February 28, 2026*\n\nThis document maps the five core controversies structuring the Bitcoin quantum resistance debate. Each debate is an active, ongoing disagreement among named participants with documented positions. Cross-references point to companion files covering threat models (`../01-threat-model/`), proposals and BIPs (`../03-proposals-and-bips/`), signature schemes (`../04-signature-schemes/`), and community sentiment (`../08-community-sentiment/`).\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Bitcoin quantum resistance debate is not a single controversy \u2014 it is at least five overlapping arguments, each with its own set of participants, stakes, and decision-making implications. The table below maps each debate to its primary participants and current status.\n\n| # | Debate | Status | Most Polarized Camps |\n|---|--------|--------|----------------------|\n| 1 | Timeline \u2014 When will the threat arrive? | Ongoing, unresolved | 2\u201310 years (Edwards, Heilman) vs. 20\u201340 years (Back, Saylor) |\n| 2 | Signature scheme selection \u2014 Which PQC algorithm? | Active BIP process | Hash-based (Corallo, Nick) vs. lattice-based (BTQ, Beast) |\n| 3 | Legacy UTXO handling \u2014 What happens to old coins? | Highly contentious | Freeze/burn (Lopp, Wuille) vs. no confiscation (Todd, Bendiksen) |\n| 4 | Upgrade mechanism \u2014 Soft fork or hard fork? | Soft-fork consensus emerging | Soft fork (Beast, Lopp) vs. hard fork (BTQ) |\n| 5 | Priority \u2014 Should work begin now? | Unresolved | Start immediately (Heilman, Carter) vs. not yet (Back, Wuille) |\n\nParticipants in these debates are documented in full in [key-researchers.md](./key-researchers.md) and [organizations.md](./organizations.md).\n\n---\n\n## Debate 1: Timeline \u2014 When Will Quantum Computers Threaten Bitcoin?\n\n### What Is Being Debated\n\nThe central empirical question: how long until a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) can break Bitcoin's elliptic curve cryptography, specifically secp256k1? The answer has enormous downstream consequences \u2014 if the answer is 5 years, every other debate becomes urgent; if it is 40 years, there is time to wait for standardization to mature. Because no one can know the answer with certainty, participants' positions often reveal risk tolerances as much as technical judgments. See `../01-threat-model/` for detailed technical parameters.\n\n### The \"Imminent Threat\" Camp (2\u201315 Years)\n\nThe most urgent voices come from outside Bitcoin's core developer community. Charles Edwards of Capriole Investments warned at TOKEN2049 in October 2025 that \"within two to eight years, the quantum machine will break the existing elliptic curve cryptography of Bitcoin,\" and declared \"we have to fix this next year, or bon voyage\" ([KuCoin research summary](https://kucoin.com), December 2025). Ethan Heilman, a co-author of the FROST protocol, has written that the 7-year migration timeline needed for Bitcoin means starting now is \"already almost too late\" ([Heilman NTC post](https://www.ethanheilman.com/x/32/index.html)). The Human Rights Foundation's Presidio Bitcoin Summit report from October 2025 cited approximately 80 specialists who estimated a CRQC \"within 5\u201310 years\" ([Yahoo Finance HRF report](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hrf-warns-quantum-computers-could-210316010.html)).\n\nProject Eleven CEO Alex Pruden has been bluntest of all: \"The threat is no longer theoretical, it's imminent\" ([Tech.eu, June 2025](https://tech.eu)). Vitalik Buterin, speaking about Ethereum but relevant to the broader cryptographic ecosystem, estimated approximately a 20% probability of a CRQC by 2030 and warned it \"could fail before the next US presidential election\" ([DL News, February 2026](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/vitalik-proposes-quantum-roadmap-for-ethereum/)). Supporting hardware evidence: Google's revised qubit-count estimate for breaking RSA-2048 dropped from tens of millions to approximately 900,000, with a preprint suggesting the threshold may be below 100,000 ([TechFlow, February 2026](https://tech.eu) \u2014 specific preprint unverified; treat as blog-sourced estimate, not peer-reviewed).\n\n### The \"Decades Away\" Camp (20\u201340+ Years)\n\nBitcoin's most prominent cypherpunks and long-time developers are significantly less alarmed. Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and one of Satoshi's cited influences, stated in November 2025 that quantum computers threatening Bitcoin are \"probably not for 20\u201340 years, if then\" ([Yahoo Finance CoinShares report context](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinshares-says-only-10-200-170531015.html)). Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy, said on the Coin Stories podcast on February 24, 2026 that the threat is \"more than 10 years out \u2014 it's not a this-decade thing\" ([Gate.com, February 2026](https://gate.com)). Pieter Wuille, author of Segregated Witness and a Bitcoin Core contributor, stated in February 2025: \"I certainly agree there is no urgency at present\" ([WEEX analysis](https://www.weex.com/news/detail/in-the-face-of-the-quantum-threat-bitcoin-core-developers-have-chosen-to-ignore-it-346468)). CoinShares' research desk noted that breaking Bitcoin would require quantum machines approximately 100,000\u00d7 more powerful than anything currently operational, concluding the threat is \"at least a decade away\" ([Yahoo Finance, February 2026](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinshares-says-only-10-200-170531015.html)).\n\n### The Moderate \"Within a Decade\" Camp\n\nMatt Corallo occupies a careful middle position: \"10, 15 years, when a cryptographically relevant quantum computer is kind of more imminent\" is the timeframe where he expects the conversation to shift ([Stephan Livera SLP719](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/719/)). Chaincode Labs' post-quantum research report uses \"CRQCs could arrive within the next decade\" as a planning assumption and argues this justifies a dual-track approach: research now, activate contingency measures within two years ([Chaincode PDF](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf)). Nic Carter has framed the moderate position succinctly: the risk is \"sufficiently advanced that it's no longer reasonable to deride as mere FUD\" ([Tech.eu, June 2025](https://tech.eu)).\n\n**Implication for other debates:** Timeline beliefs are not merely academic \u2014 they determine the urgency of every other debate. Someone who believes the threat is 30 years away will naturally resist committing to a signature scheme or legacy UTXO policy today.\n\n---\n\n## Debate 2: Signature Scheme Selection \u2014 Which PQC Algorithm Should Bitcoin Adopt?\n\n### What Is Being Debated\n\nOnce the decision is made to upgrade, Bitcoin must choose which post-quantum signature scheme (or schemes) to adopt. The candidates differ significantly in signature size, verification speed, cryptographic assumptions, and standardization maturity. This debate intersects directly with `../04-signature-schemes/` and the BIP-360 process documented in `../03-proposals-and-bips/`.\n\n### Hash-Based Schemes (SHRINCS / SPHINCS+ / XMSS)\n\nMatt Corallo has staked out the clearest position among Bitcoin Core\u2013adjacent developers: \"I think right now the only thing to do would be to add hash-based signatures in Bitcoin,\" and specifically endorses SHRINCS \u2014 a hybrid of XMSS and SPHINCS+ producing 324-byte signatures on the normal path. He added: \"I don't think there will be a lot more discussion aside from just doing [SHRINCS]\" ([Stephan Livera SLP719](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/719/)). Jonas Nick of Blockstream co-developed SHRINCS and proposed it on Delving Bitcoin in December 2025 ([Delving Bitcoin SHRINCS post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/shrincs-324-byte-stateful-post-quantum-signatures-with-static-backups/2158)). The Chaincode Labs report recommends hash-based schemes for conservative deployments on the grounds that their security relies only on the collision resistance of hash functions \u2014 not on novel hardness assumptions whose quantum resistance remains less empirically tested ([Chaincode PDF](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf)).\n\n### Lattice-Based and NIST-Standardized Schemes\n\nBTQ Technologies' Bitcoin Quantum testnet, launched in January 2026, chose ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FIPS 204) as its primary scheme, arguing it is \"the same NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptographic algorithm mandated by the U.S. government for protecting national security systems\" ([Barchart.com, January 2026](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/36995126/btq-technologies-launches-bitcoin-quantum-testnet)). BIP-360's current shortlist, as updated by Hunter Beast in February 2025, includes FALCON (FN-DSA-512) as the preferred option for its small signature size and aggregation potential, with ML-DSA-44 and SLH-DSA-Shake-128s as secondary options ([Google Groups BIP-360 update](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/oQKezDOc4us)). The libbitcoinpqc reference library implements all three: ML-DSA-44, SLH-DSA-Shake-128s, and FN-DSA-512 ([GitHub libbitcoinpqc](https://github.com)).\n\n### Algorithm Agility vs. Single-Algorithm Commitment\n\nHunter Beast (the original BIP-360 author) has argued for including multiple algorithm options: \"I think it's still important to include multiple signature algorithm options for users to select their desired level of security. It's not 100% certain that all of these algorithms will remain quantum resistant for all time, so redundancy here is\u2026 key\" ([Google Groups, February 2025](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/oQKezDOc4us)). Tim Ruffing raised complexity concerns about the multi-algorithm approach. BIP editor Murch noted concern about \"introducing four new algorithms\" and adding \"too much complexity\" to the protocol. Notably, SQIsign \u2014 once considered a candidate \u2014 was deprecated from BIP-360 due to signature verification running approximately 15,000\u00d7 slower than ECDSA, making it impractical for Bitcoin's use case ([Google Groups BIP-360 update](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/oQKezDOc4us)).\n\n**The unresolved tension:** Hash-based advocates prioritize security conservatism and minimal cryptographic assumptions; lattice-based advocates prioritize NIST standardization, government interoperability, and signature size performance. No consensus exists as of early 2026.\n\n---\n\n## Debate 3: Legacy UTXO Handling \u2014 What Happens to Coins in Quantum-Vulnerable Addresses?\n\n### What Is Being Debated\n\nThis is arguably the most politically charged sub-debate. An estimated 4\u20135 million BTC sit in addresses where the public key is exposed (pay-to-public-key outputs and reused P2PKH addresses), making them potentially vulnerable to a CRQC. The question: should the Bitcoin protocol force migration, freeze those coins, allow them to be taken, or do nothing? This debate implicates Bitcoin's foundational property-rights norms and intersects with `../08-community-sentiment/`. Satoshi Nakamoto's approximately 1 million BTC is included in the exposed category, adding enormous political weight ([CoinGape, Ki Young Ju analysis](https://coingape.com/bitcoin-quantum-threat-ju-flags-risk-of-losing-satoshis-1m-btc-stash-to-hackers/)).\n\n### \"Allow Natural Migration\" \u2014 No Protocol Coercion\n\nCoinShares research director Christopher Bendiksen argued that burning or freezing quantum-vulnerable UTXOs is \"fundamentally contradictory to Bitcoin's principles\" ([Yahoo Finance, February 2026](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinshares-says-only-10-200-170531015.html)). Peter Todd described disabling keypath spends for old addresses as \"extremely confiscatory\" in the Bitcoin-dev mailing list in December 2024 ([Google Groups archive](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/oQKezDOc4us)). Tim Ruffing argued in July 2025 that pre-burning coins for \"something that may never happen\" is the wrong direction ([WEEX analysis](https://www.weex.com/news/detail/in-the-face-of-the-quantum-threat-bitcoin-core-developers-have-chosen-to-ignore-it-346468)). BIP-360 itself (P2QRH/P2MR) is designed as an optional migration destination, not a forced replacement \u2014 users migrate at their own pace.\n\n### \"Freeze and Confiscate\" \u2014 Protocol-Enforced Deadline\n\nJameson Lopp's migration BIP, co-authored with five others and posted to BitcoinTalk in July 2025, proposes three phases: Phase A activates quantum-safe addresses; Phase B, five years later, renders legacy UTXOs unspendable; Phase C optionally allows ZK-proof-based recovery for users who can prove seed phrase ownership ([Presidio Bitcoin Substack](https://presidiobitcoin.substack.com/p/insights-from-the-quantum-bitcoin)). Pieter Wuille \u2014 despite otherwise being in the \"no urgency\" camp on timeline \u2014 has been unambiguous on the confiscation question: \"Of course they have to be confiscated. If and when the existence of a cryptography-breaking QC becomes a credible threat, the Bitcoin ecosystem has no other option\" (cited in Lopp's essay). This remarkable position \u2014 concede no urgency on timeline, but accept confiscation as the correct outcome if the threat materializes \u2014 defines the moderate-conservative position within Bitcoin Core circles.\n\n### \"Burning Is Preferable to Quantum Theft\"\n\nJameson Lopp's essay [\"Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin\"](https://blog.lopp.net/against-quantum-recovery-of-bitcoin/) (March 2025) advances a stronger claim: even if we could prevent quantum theft, we should not allow quantum recovery of coins. \"Quantum recovered coins only make everyone else's coins worth less. Think of it as a theft from everyone.\" This argument reframes the debate from property rights to network integrity: the monetary supply effect of millions of \"dead\" BTC returning to circulation is itself a form of harm to all holders.\n\n### The Status Quo (No Action)\n\nThe implicit outcome of inaction is that a sufficiently powerful adversary \u2014 potentially a nation-state \u2014 could drain quantum-vulnerable addresses. Nic Carter's [Murmuration Two essay \"Bitcoin Developers Are Sleepwalking\"](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-developers-are-sleepwalking) describes this scenario as catastrophic for Bitcoin's credibility and value proposition. No prominent figure explicitly advocates for this outcome \u2014 but several positions implicitly accept it as the result of prioritizing property-rights orthodoxy over migration urgency.\n\n---\n\n## Debate 4: Upgrade Mechanism \u2014 Soft Fork vs. Hard Fork\n\n### What Is Being Debated\n\nBitcoin has not executed a contentious hard fork since the 2017 block-size wars, and that episode remains politically traumatic in the ecosystem. The upgrade mechanism debate therefore touches deep cultural norms about Bitcoin's governance, not just technical tradeoffs. The question: can quantum resistance be achieved via soft fork (backward-compatible, no chain split required), or does the scale of changes require a hard fork? This intersects with `../03-proposals-and-bips/` on the BIP process.\n\n### The Soft Fork Consensus\n\nAmong Bitcoin developers and most serious researchers, the strong preference is for soft forks. Hunter Beast has been explicit: \"I think it's important that we work within the BIPs process and do a soft fork. There aren't hard forks\" ([QRL Show YouTube, February 2026](https://www.youtube.com)). Jameson Lopp's migration BIP is designed to \"avoid hard forks and preserve Bitcoin's conservative upgrade culture\" ([Presidio Bitcoin Substack](https://presidiobitcoin.substack.com/p/insights-from-the-quantum-bitcoin)). Matt Corallo's OP_SHRINCSVERIFY proposal would be implemented as a tapscript opcode \u2014 a soft fork by definition. BIP-360 (P2QRH/P2MR) is explicitly designed as a backward-compatible soft fork, using a new output type within the existing witness structure.\n\nTadge Dryja has proposed two soft-fork mechanisms that address the threat without requiring full PQ signature adoption. First, a \"PoQC kill-switch\" \u2014 an on-chain proof of a quantum computer that auto-triggers defensive logic \u2014 presented at the Presidio Summit and in a December 2024 mailing list post: \"If this evaluates to true, I'm all for it \u2014 activate, there's no more debate\" ([Google Groups, December 2024](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/oQKezDOc4us)). Second, a \"Lifeboat\" commit/reveal scheme that protects against short-range attacks without requiring a full PQ signature scheme rollout, reported by [DL News in June 2025](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/bitcoin-devs-to-protect-blockchain-from-quantum-computers/).\n\n### The Hard Fork Position\n\nBTQ Technologies' Bitcoin Quantum testnet is explicitly a hard fork, featuring 64 MiB blocks, ML-DSA replacing ECDSA system-wide, and a fundamentally different signature layer. BTQ's CEO justified this by arguing: \"The quantum threat doesn't wait for consensus\" ([Barchart.com, January 2026](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/36995126/btq-technologies-launches-bitcoin-quantum-testnet)). This position is an outlier within the broader community \u2014 BTQ's testnet is notable as a proof-of-concept but is not backed by Core developers, and its hard-fork approach is widely viewed as politically unacceptable regardless of its technical merits.\n\n**The asymmetry:** The soft-fork preference is not merely political preference \u2014 it reflects Bitcoin's security model, where node operators must opt in to rule changes. A hard fork that forces rule changes without network-wide consensus would undermine the property guarantees that make Bitcoin valuable in the first place.\n\n---\n\n## Debate 5: Priority \u2014 Should This Be Worked on Now?\n\n### What Is Being Debated\n\nEven people who agree on the eventual need for quantum resistance disagree about when work should begin. This is partly a timeline question, but it also involves resource allocation, opportunity cost, distraction from other protocol improvements, and the risk of locking in premature decisions. Community sentiment is tracked in `../08-community-sentiment/`.\n\n### \"Start Immediately\" Camp\n\nEthan Heilman has written: \"I strongly believe Bitcoin will need to move to PQ signatures in the near future\" and points to the migration timeline as the key driver \u2014 even a slow, careful migration requires years of lead time ([Heilman NTC post](https://www.ethanheilman.com/x/32/index.html)). Nic Carter has argued it is \"in everyone's interest that we address these as soon as possible\" and that the broader community's failure to act constitutes \"sleepwalking\" into a preventable crisis ([Murmuration Two Substack](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-developers-are-sleepwalking)). Charles Edwards escalated in December 2025: \"We have to fix this next year, or bon voyage\" ([KuCoin, December 2025](https://kucoin.com)). Chaincode Labs' dual-track report argues that contingency measures should be implemented within two years, regardless of when the threat actually materializes ([Chaincode PDF](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf)). Hunter Beast, Jameson Lopp, and Project Eleven CEO Alex Pruden all advocate for beginning work now.\n\nForbes noted in February 2026 that BIP-360 represents \"Bitcoin's first step against quantum computers\" \u2014 signaling that mainstream coverage is beginning to treat the topic as action-worthy rather than theoretical ([Forbes, February 2026](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/)).\n\n### \"Not Yet \u2014 Other Priorities\" Camp\n\nAdam Back has repeatedly argued that Bitcoin will be quantum-ready \"long before cryptographically relevant quantum computers arrive\" and that the ecosystem should not be distracted from more pressing protocol work ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinshares-says-only-10-200-170531015.html)). Michael Saylor maintains the community \"will see the threat coming and respond\" and that there is no current urgency ([Coin Stories podcast, February 24, 2026](https://gate.com)). Pieter Wuille, Peter Todd, and Luke Dashjr have all expressed that quantum resistance is not currently an actionable problem. Nic Carter's analysis of this community notes that most influential Core developers treat quantum as \"theoretical, distant, and not actionable\" \u2014 which he characterizes as a dangerous complacency ([Murmuration Two Substack](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-developers-are-sleepwalking)).\n\n### \"Research Yes, Implementation No\" \u2014 The Middle Path\n\nMatt Corallo's position is nuanced and represents what may be the pragmatic consensus among serious Bitcoin developers. He advocates for adding a hidden PQ commitment to transactions now \u2014 a zero-cost insurance policy that costs almost nothing to include but preserves optionality \u2014 while deferring the activation decision until the threat is clearer: \"I think that should be done soon... hopefully soon\" ([Stephan Livera SLP719](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/719/)). Tim Ruffing and other Blockstream researchers are engaged in active PQC research but have not argued for urgency in protocol changes. Andrew Poelstra, also at Blockstream, has not staked out an explicit position on the activation timeline.\n\nThis middle camp tends to argue: (1) we do not yet know which algorithm will win; (2) premature commitment locks in a potentially suboptimal choice; (3) the research can be done now without the urgency of activation; and (4) the community will be able to respond with sufficient speed once the threat becomes concrete. Critics of this position argue it underestimates the coordination time required for Bitcoin consensus changes \u2014 historically measured in years, not months.\n\n---\n\n## Structural Analysis: How the Five Debates Interconnect\n\nThe five debates are not independent. Timeline beliefs cascade into priority beliefs; priority beliefs constrain which signature schemes receive serious development attention; scheme selection interacts with upgrade mechanism design; and legacy UTXO handling is only necessary if an upgrade actually happens.\n\n```\nTIMELINE ASSESSMENT\n        \u2502\n        \u25bc\n   PRIORITY LEVEL \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n        \u2502                                            \u2502\n        \u25bc                                            \u25bc\nSCHEME SELECTION                         LEGACY UTXO HANDLING\n   (Hash vs. Lattice vs. Agility)        (Freeze vs. Burn vs. Natural)\n        \u2502\n        \u25bc\nUPGRADE MECHANISM\n   (Soft Fork vs. Hard Fork)\n```\n\nCritically, participants who are dismissive on timeline tend to be permissive on legacy UTXOs (let users migrate naturally; no urgency) and agnostic on scheme selection (the NIST process will mature; no need to rush). Participants who are alarmed on timeline tend to favor freezing legacy UTXOs (the threat mandates action) and prefer conservative hash-based schemes (proven security, less new attack surface).\n\nThe one cross-cutting agreement is on upgrade mechanism: nearly all serious Bitcoin stakeholders \u2014 across all five positions \u2014 prefer a soft fork over a hard fork. BTQ Technologies is the outlier, and its hard-fork testnet is viewed by most as a research exercise rather than a realistic deployment path.\n\n---\n\n## Key Unresolved Questions\n\n1. **Will the NIST PQC standardization process (completed in 2024) produce a clear winner for Bitcoin?** FALCON, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA are all now NIST standards \u2014 but their suitability for Bitcoin's specific use case (small scripts, global verification, aggregation) continues to be debated.\n\n2. **Can BIP-360's multi-algorithm approach survive simplification pressure?** The tension between algorithm agility (Hunter Beast's position) and simplicity (Murch, Tim Ruffing) is unresolved in the BIP process.\n\n3. **Who decides when the quantum threat is \"real enough\" to act?** No formal threshold exists. Tadge Dryja's PoQC kill-switch proposes an on-chain oracle mechanism, but it requires prior soft-fork activation. The governance question \u2014 who verifies a CRQC claim? \u2014 is unanswered.\n\n4. **What happens to Satoshi's coins?** The political weight of approximately 1 million BTC in early P2PK outputs (attributable to Satoshi with high confidence) means any legacy UTXO freeze policy becomes a de facto decision about the founder's holdings. This adds extraordinary political complexity to an already contentious debate.\n\n---\n\n*See also:*\n- *[key-researchers.md](./key-researchers.md) \u2014 Biographical and positional profiles of 18 key individuals*\n- *[organizations.md](./organizations.md) \u2014 Profiles of 14 organizations and their roles in the debate*\n- *`../01-threat-model/` \u2014 Technical parameters of the quantum threat*\n- *`../03-proposals-and-bips/` \u2014 BIP-360, the Lopp migration BIP, and related proposals*\n- *`../04-signature-schemes/` \u2014 Technical comparison of PQC candidates*\n- *`../08-community-sentiment/` \u2014 Polling data, social media analysis, and community surveys*\n",

  "07-timeline-and-risk/bitcoin-migration-timeline": "# Bitcoin's Quantum Migration Timeline: How Long Will It Really Take?\n\n\n> **Last updated:** February 28, 2026 | **Confidence shelf-life:** 6 months (dependent on BIP progress)\n\n\n*Compiled: February 2026 | Cross-references: `../03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md`, `quantum-progress-timeline.md`, `gap-analysis.md`*\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Fundamental Constraint: Bitcoin's Upgrade Velocity\n\nThe single most important fact in assessing Bitcoin's quantum migration timeline is that Bitcoin's upgrade process is slow by design. The protocol has no central authority, no emergency override, and no mechanism for forcing users to upgrade. Every change requires the consent of an economic majority across a globally distributed network of developers, miners, node operators, exchanges, custodians, and millions of individual holders.\n\nThis creates a structural tension: the quantum threat may arrive on a hardware-determined schedule, but Bitcoin's response operates on a social-consensus schedule. Per [Forbes (Feb 2026)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/), even under the most optimistic scenario of **immediate consensus**, achieving full quantum resistance would take approximately **seven years**: three years for BIP finalization, code review, testing, and community consensus; six months for activation; and several additional years for the broader ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Historical Precedent: How Long Have Previous Upgrades Actually Taken?\n\n### SegWit (BIP-141)\n\n| Phase | Date | Duration |\n|-------|------|----------|\n| First proposal concept | Oct 2015 | \u2014 |\n| BIP-141 formally drafted | Dec 2015 | \u2014 |\n| Activation threshold locked in | Aug 2017 | 20 months from BIP draft |\n| SegWit transaction adoption >50% | Jun 2019 | ~3.5 years from BIP draft |\n| SegWit adoption near-complete | 2022 | ~7 years from concept |\n\nSegWit was contentious \u2014 miner resistance and the \"block size wars\" delayed activation despite clear technical benefits. The [JBBA hybrid PQ paper (Dec 2025)](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) notes SegWit was proposed December 2015 and activated August 2017 \u2014 \"less than 2 years from proposal to activation, but with immense social conflict that nearly split the network.\"\n\n### Taproot (BIP-340/341/342)\n\n| Phase | Date | Duration |\n|-------|------|----------|\n| Initial Schnorr signature proposal | Jan 2018 | \u2014 |\n| BIP-340, 341, 342 finalized | Jan 2020 | \u2014 |\n| Activation locked in | Jun 2021 | ~17 months from BIP finalization |\n| Activation at block 709,632 | Nov 2021 | ~22 months from BIP finalization |\n| Taproot adoption >50% | Ongoing (still growing) | \u2014 |\n\nTaproot succeeded relatively smoothly because it offered **tangible benefits** (privacy, fee reduction, smart contract capability) with minimal costs. Per the [JBBA paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf): \"Unlike beneficial upgrades like SegWit (which took <2 years despite offering improvements), PQC migration is a purely defensive measure imposing only costs.\"\n\n### The Asymmetry That Changes Everything\n\nThe critical observation from [soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md](../03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md) in this corpus: Bitcoin's PQ migration imposes a **50\u201370% throughput reduction** and **2\u20133\u00d7 fee increases** with zero immediate benefit to users. The [JBBA paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) writes plainly: \"Even beneficial upgrades faced massive resistance. SegWit, despite offering clear capacity increases, triggered the Bitcoin Block Size War that nearly split the network. A purely costly downgrade faces exponentially higher resistance.\"\n\nProjected outcomes per the JBBA paper:\n- **Best case (Crisis Motivation)**: 5\u20137 years\n- **Probable case (Human Nature)**: 10\u201315 years\n- **Most likely outcome**: \"Stalls indefinitely until a quantum computer is demonstrated\"\n\n---\n\n## 3. Current Status: BIP-360 and the Road Ahead\n\n### What BIP-360 Actually Is (Feb 2026)\n\nBIP-360 (Pay-to-Merkle-Root, P2MR) was **merged into the Bitcoin BIP repository on February 11, 2026**, per [Forbes (Feb 2026)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/) and announced by Bitcoin Core developer Murch. Three facts about this event are critical:\n\n1. **The merge is documentation, not activation**: The BIPs repository explicitly warns that publication \"doesn't imply consensus, adoption, or that the idea is even good,\" per [CryptoSlate (Feb 2026)](https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-devs-merge-new-plan-to-limit-quantum-exposure-risk-but-you-pay-in-fees-and-privacy/).\n\n2. **P2MR addresses long-exposure only**: BIP-360 hides public keys in a Merkle tree root, preventing the \"long-exposure\" attack where a quantum computer with unlimited time derives a private key from an exposed public key. It does **not** address the \"short-exposure\" attack during a transaction's mempool window \u2014 that requires a subsequent BIP adding post-quantum signature opcodes.\n\n3. **No signature scheme is included**: BIP-360 co-author Ethan Heilman confirmed the proposal \"represents only the first step\"; full quantum security requires integration of a post-quantum signature algorithm in a separate BIP, per [Forbes (Feb 2026)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/).\n\nA [LinkedIn analysis (Feb 2026)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/6-massive-challenges-bitcoin-faces-road-quantum-security-jlenc) notes: \"BIP-360 has increased its chances of activation by not implementing a signature scheme,\" acknowledging that the community is far more likely to agree on the simpler output type than on a specific PQ algorithm.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Multi-Phase Upgrade Sequence\n\nFull quantum security for Bitcoin requires a sequence of at least four distinct soft fork activations, plus ecosystem-wide migration. As documented in [soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md](../03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md):\n\n**Soft Fork 1 (BIP-360 P2MR)**: New P2MR output type; removes long-exposure keypath vulnerability from Taproot. Status: *Merged into BIP repository, Feb 2026. Requires activation signal from miners + ecosystem support. No activation date set.*\n\n**Soft Fork 2 (PQ Signature Opcode)**: Adds `OP_SLHDSA`, `OP_MLDSA`, or equivalent to tapscript. Provides short-exposure protection when combined with P2MR. Status: *Active research; multiple proposals (OP_SPHINCS by Corallo, OP_CAT/Winternitz by Conduition, STARK compression by Heilman). No consensus on which algorithm.*\n\n**Soft Fork 3 (Witness Discount)**: Increases the witness discount to accommodate PQ signature sizes without destroying throughput.

The UTXO Migration Arithmetic\n\nThe [Chaincode Labs paper (May 2025)](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) calculates that migrating all UTXOs to quantum-resistant addresses would require **76 to 568 days** of block space, depending on:\n- Whether users migrate voluntarily or under deadline pressure\n- The size overhead of PQ signatures (10\u2013100\u00d7 larger than Schnorr)\n- Whether STARK compression is available to reduce per-transaction footprint\n- Available block space not consumed by normal economic activity\n\nThis is a **minimum physical timeline** for the migration mechanics. It assumes all users simultaneously begin migrating \u2014 an assumption contradicted by every historical precedent in cryptocurrency adoption.\n\nReal-world adoption curves suggest:\n- **Early adopters** (security-conscious holders, institutions under regulatory pressure): 10\u201320% of value within 1\u20132 years of activation\n- **Majority adoption**: 3\u20137 years (matching Taproot's still-incomplete adoption curve)\n- **Long tail** (lost keys, old hardware wallets, unresponsive custodians): Indefinite\n\nPer the [human rights and policy analysis](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/6-massive-challenges-bitcoin-faces-road-quantum-security-jlenc): \"The community could decide to make the coins that don't upgrade non-transferable, effectively burning them and setting their value to 0.\" Jameson Lopp co-authored the post-BIP-360 \"QBIP\" which would follow three years after BIP-360, implementing address restrictions.\n\n---\n\n## 7. The Governance Challenge: Why This Migration Is Harder Than All Prior Upgrades\n\nThe [JBBA hybrid PQ paper (Dec 2025)](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) provides the clearest framing:\n\n| Upgrade | Benefits | Costs | Time to Activation | Adoption |\n|---------|----------|-------|---------------------|---------|\n| SegWit | +Capacity, Lightning | Complexity | <2 years | Slow (years) |\n| Taproot | +Privacy, smart contracts | Minimal | <2 years | Moderate |\n| **PQ Migration** | **None (future risk mitigation)** | **\u221250% capacity, 3\u00d7 fees** | **???** | **???** |\n\n\"Critical Insight: Even beneficial upgrades faced massive resistance.

The \"Long Tail\" Problem\n\nThe long tail is Bitcoin's defining migration challenge. Unlike traditional software where organizations control their own infrastructure, Bitcoin holders include:\n\n- **Lost key holders**: An estimated 3\u20134 million BTC are provably lost; their addresses remain in the UTXO set indefinitely\n- **Satoshi's ~1.1 million BTC in P2PK addresses**: These will never be voluntarily migrated \u2014 any action requires a community-wide decision to either burn, freeze, or allow theft\n- **Old hardware wallets**: Devices from 2013\u20132018 that may not receive firmware updates\n- **Institutional custodians with legacy systems**: Multi-year technology refresh cycles\n- **Unresponsive or defunct custodians**: Customer coins held by failed or acquired entities\n\nPer the [HRF October 2025 report cited by Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/): approximately **1.72 million BTC** (including Satoshi's ~1.1M) reside in P2PK format \u2014 the highest-risk, never-migrated category representing an unresolved philosophical question about property rights and protocol immutability.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Freeze Mitigation: Recovery Schemes for Quasi-Frozen Coins\n\n[BitMEX Research (February 2026)](https://www.bitmex.com/blog/Mitigating-The-Impact-Of-The-Quantum-Freeze) proposed four methods to recover coins that would otherwise be permanently frozen in a quantum freeze scenario, potentially transforming the \"burn vs. allow theft\" binary into a more nuanced \"freeze with recovery\" approach.\n\n### 10.1 Recovery Methods Overview\n\n| Method | Transactions Required | Advance Preparation | Works After Address Reuse? | Reusable? |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Commitment Recovery | 2 (setup + recovery) | Yes (100+ blocks before recovery) | No | No |\n| Seed Phrase Commitment | 2 (setup + recovery) | Yes (100+ blocks before recovery) | Yes | No |\n| Pre-QDay Commitment | 2 (setup before QDay + recovery) | Yes (before QDay) | Yes | No |\n| ZKP Seed Phrase (STARK) | 1 | No | Yes | Yes |\n\n### 10.2 Key Technical Insights\n\n**BIP-39 derivation is quantum-safe.** The step from BIP-39 seed words to master private key uses PBKDF2 with SHA-512 \u2014 a hash-based process unaffected by Shor's algorithm. While a quantum computer can derive private key \u2192 public key (breaking ECDSA), it cannot reverse the hash-based seed \u2192 private key derivation. This makes seed phrase knowledge a quantum-safe proof of ownership, per [BitMEX Research](https://www.bitmex.com/blog/Mitigating-The-Impact-Of-The-Quantum-Freeze).\n\n**STARK-based ZKP requires no advance preparation.** The ZKP seed phrase method allows users to prove seed phrase knowledge without revealing it, using quantum-safe STARK proofs. Unlike commitment-based methods, users need not do anything before QDay \u2014 they simply upgrade wallets post-freeze to include ZKP proofs. This is a significant practical advantage: \"People can continue using their wallet as normal until the freeze, then upgrade their wallets to add the new ZKP output and continue to spend their coins,\" per [BitMEX Research](https://www.bitmex.com/blog/Mitigating-The-Impact-Of-The-Quantum-Freeze).\n\n**Pre-QDay commitment enables Satoshi recovery.** For P2PK coins where no seed phrase exists, a hash commitment placed on-chain before QDay proves pre-quantum ownership. A single 256-bit Merkle root can cover thousands of UTXOs. [BitMEX Research](https://www.bitmex.com/blog/Mitigating-The-Impact-Of-The-Quantum-Freeze) noted this could allow Satoshi to preserve plausible deniability while retaining recovery capability.\n\n### 10.3 Coverage Analysis\n\nPer BitMEX Research's UTXO table (sourced from [Dune Analytics / murchandamus](https://dune.com/murchandamus/bitcoins-utxo-set)):\n\n- **~90.5% of supply** (P2WPKH + P2PKH + P2SH + P2WSH) has access to all recovery methods including ZKP (no advance prep needed)\n- **~1.0% of supply** (Taproot / 196,292 BTC) can use Seed Phrase Commitment and ZKP methods\n- **~8.6% of supply** (P2PK / 1,716,419 BTC) is limited to Pre-QDay Commitment only\n- Only P2PK coins where no seed phrase was used AND no pre-QDay commitment was made would be truly unrecoverable\n\n### 10.4 Implications for the Migration Timeline\n\nThe existence of post-freeze recovery methods changes the timeline calculus. If recovery is possible, the freeze can be more aggressive (earlier) without permanently destroying as many coins. This partially resolves the freeze timing dilemma identified in the BitMEX Part 2 analysis, where the need for user preparation (pushing the freeze later) conflicted with the need for a safety margin (pushing it earlier). With ZKP recovery, users who fail to migrate before the freeze are not permanently punished \u2014 they simply face higher transaction costs for recovery.\n\nHowever, the recovery methods require significant soft fork protocol upgrades, add complexity and potential DoS vulnerabilities for node operators, and have not been formalized into BIPs. The STARK-based ZKP method in particular depends on ZKP tooling (proof generation, verification) that is still maturing in a Bitcoin context.\n\n---\n\n*Sources: [Forbes BIP-360 (Feb 2026)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/), [CryptoSlate BIP-360 analysis (Feb 2026)](https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-devs-merge-new-plan-to-limit-quantum-exposure-risk-but-you-pay-in-fees-and-privacy/), [Chaincode Labs paper (May 2025)](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf), [JBBA hybrid PQ paper (Dec 2025)](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf), [LinkedIn 6 challenges (Feb 2026)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/6-massive-challenges-bitcoin-faces-road-quantum-security-jlenc), [Soft Fork vs. Hard Fork analysis](../03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md), [BitMEX Research \u2014 Lamport Signatures (Jul 2025)](https://www.bitmex.com/blog/quantum-safe-lamport-signatures), [BitMEX Research \u2014 Taproot Quantum Spend Paths (Jan 2026)](https://www.bitmex.com/blog/Taproot-Quantum-Spend-Paths), [BitMEX Research \u2014 Quantum Freeze (Feb 2026)](https://www.bitmex.com/blog/Mitigating-The-Impact-Of-The-Quantum-Freeze)*\n",

The Key Question: Does a Risk Window Exist?\n\nThe central risk question for Bitcoin is not simply \"when will a CRQC exist?\" or \"how long will migration take?\" It is whether **T_quantum** (the date a cryptographically relevant quantum computer capable of breaking secp256k1 ECDSA-256 exists) will precede **T_migration** (the date Bitcoin has sufficient quantum-resistant infrastructure deployed to protect the majority of funds).\n\nFormally:\n\n**Gap = T_quantum \u2212 T_migration**\n\n- If **Gap < 0**: Migration completes before CRQC exists. No theft risk, though \"harvest now, decrypt later\" data collection has already occurred.\n- If **Gap = 0**: Near-simultaneous. Emergency migration possible but chaotic.\n- If **Gap > 0**: A risk window exists. Funds in quantum-vulnerable addresses can be stolen for the duration of the gap.\n\nBased on all evidence reviewed, a **positive gap \u2014 a meaningful risk window \u2014 is the most probable outcome** under current trajectories.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Defining T_quantum\n\nAs established in [quantum-progress-timeline.md](./quantum-progress-timeline.md), T_quantum for Bitcoin's ECDSA-256 requires approximately **2,330 logical qubits** (R\u00f6tteler et al. 2017) with gate fidelity sufficient for sustained multi-hour computation. Key reference points:\n\n- **ECDSA-256 is easier to break than RSA-2048**: Breaking 256-bit ECC requires fewer logical qubits than RSA-2048. A CRQC for Bitcoin will arrive before one sufficient to break RSA, per [Proos & Zalka (2003)](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301141) and [key-findings-synthesis.md](../02-academic-research/key-findings-synthesis.md).\n- **Current best**: Quantinuum Helios has 48 logical qubits (Feb 2026) \u2014 approximately **50\u00d7 short** of the Bitcoin-relevant threshold.\n- **Near-term roadmaps**: IBM Blue Jay (2033, ~2,000 logical qubits) approaches but may not exceed the threshold; IonQ's roadmap targets 8,000 logical qubits by 2029 if all milestones are met.\n- **Prediction market consensus**: Kalshi implies 39% probability of a useful QC by 2030; Metaculus median estimate ~2034 for RSA factoring (ECDSA-256 would be earlier), per [PostQuantum.com analysis (Feb 2026)](https://postquantum.com/security-pqc/citi-quantum-threat-report/).\n\n**Working T_quantum range (as of early 2026):**\n\n| Scenario | T_quantum | Probability |\n|----------|-----------|-------------|\n| Aggressive | 2029\u20132030 | ~10\u201315% |\n| Central | 2031\u20132035 | ~50\u201360% |\n| Conservative | 2036\u20132045+ | ~25\u201335% |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Defining T_migration\n\nT_migration is not a single point \u2014 it is a range that depends on which Bitcoin holders are considered \"migrated\" and which protocol protections are in place. A pragmatic definition: **T_migration is the date by which (a) a quantum-resistant output type is widely deployed, (b) the majority of exposed UTXOs have been migrated, and (c) ecosystem infrastructure (hardware wallets, exchanges, custodians) supports the new format.**\n\nAs established in [bitcoin-migration-timeline.md](./bitcoin-migration-timeline.md):\n\n| Scenario | T_migration | Key Assumptions |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Best case | 2033\u20132035 | Immediate community mobilization; 7-year path |\n| Expected case | 2037\u20132040 | Normal Bitcoin governance friction |\n| Worst case | 2040+ or never | Stalls until crisis |\n\nThe working assumption is that the **expected T_migration is 2037\u20132040** under current governance dynamics, per the [JBBA hybrid PQ paper (Dec 2025)](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) and [Chaincode Labs (May 2025)](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Scenario Analysis\n\n### Scenario 1: No Gap (T_quantum > T_migration)\n\n**Conditions**: Quantum computing progress is slow (T_quantum ~2040+) AND Bitcoin community mobilizes immediately (T_migration ~2033\u20132035).\n\n**Assessment**: Requires both the conservative quantum timeline AND the best-case Bitcoin governance outcome. Under this scenario, Bitcoin would achieve quantum resistance before any actor has a CRQC. The probability of this scenario is **low** \u2014 approximately 10\u201315% \u2014 given that even the \"best case\" migration requires 7 years from today (completing ~2033) and the central quantum estimate places T_quantum around 2031\u20132035.\n\n**Remaining risk**: \"Harvest now, decrypt later\" data collection is already occurring (see Section 6). Even in this scenario, previously exposed public keys may be retroactively decryptable by the first entities that achieve CRQC capability.\n\n---\n\n### Scenario 2: Narrow Gap (Expected Case)\n\n**Conditions**: T_quantum around 2033\u20132035 (central estimate) AND T_migration around 2037\u20132040 (expected governance outcome).\n\n**Gap**: 2\u20137 years.\n\n**Funds at risk during gap**: Approximately 6.26\u20136.51 million BTC currently in exposed addresses (per [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf)), declining as migration progresses from T_migration start through the gap period. If 20\u201330% have migrated by T_quantum, approximately **4\u20135 million BTC** remain vulnerable during the gap.\n\n**Probability**: This is the **most likely scenario** \u2014 approximately 40\u201350% probability.\n\n**Assessment**: A 2\u20137 year gap with ~$400\u2013600 billion at risk (at current prices) represents a systemic financial event with implications beyond Bitcoin. As [Citi Institute (Jan 2026)](https://postquantum.com/security-pqc/citi-quantum-threat-report/) estimated, a quantum attack on a single major financial institution could trigger $2\u20133.3 trillion in indirect economic damage. Bitcoin's exposure is asymmetric: the first entity with a CRQC could steal billions before the capability becomes public.\n\n---\n\n### Scenario 3: Wide Gap (Governance Stalls)\n\n**Conditions**: T_quantum around 2031\u20132033 (aggressive estimate) AND T_migration stalls until a demonstrated quantum attack (T_migration = 2040+).\n\n**Gap**: 7\u201312 years.\n\n**Assessment**: The [JBBA paper (Dec 2025)](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) explicitly models this: \"Most Likely Outcome: Stalls until a quantum computer is demonstrated.\" If this occurs, the ecosystem faces an emergency migration under adversarial conditions \u2014 rising fees, panic migrations, governance crisis, and the Satoshi coin \"burn or steal\" decision made under duress. Probability: ~20\u201330%.\n\n---\n\n### Consolidated Scenario Table\n\n| Scenario | T_quantum | T_migration | Gap | Funds at Risk | Probability |\n|----------|-----------|-------------|-----|---------------|-------------|\n| **No gap** | 2038\u20132045+ | 2033\u20132035 | None | ~0 (post-migration) | ~10\u201315% |\n| **Narrow gap** | 2033\u20132035 | 2037\u20132040 | 2\u20137 years | ~4\u20135M BTC | ~40\u201350% |\n| **Wide gap** | 2030\u20132033 | 2040+ | 7\u201312+ years | ~5\u20136M BTC | ~20\u201330% |\n| **Catastrophic** | 2028\u20132030 | Never complete | Indefinite | 6.26\u20136.51M BTC | ~5\u201310% |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Risk Factors That Could Widen the Gap\n\n### 5.1 Unexpected Quantum Breakthrough\nThe algorithmic trajectory described in [quantum-progress-timeline.md](./quantum-progress-timeline.md) shows consistent 20\u00d7 improvements every ~6 years. A repeat of Gidney's 2025 result would bring CRQC requirements to roughly 50,000 physical qubits \u2014 already achievable with near-term hardware. Secret government programs may already be operating at this level. Per [Murmuration II (Nov 2025)](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-and-the-quantum-problem-part-47f), some physicists assign a \"low but nonzero\" probability that a CRQC already exists.\n\n### 5.2 Bitcoin Governance Delays\nMultiple sources identify Bitcoin's conservative governance culture as a significant factor widening the gap. The [JBBA paper (Dec 2025)](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) models governance delay as the dominant variable in its \"Most Likely\" scenario, and the [LinkedIn 6-challenges analysis (Feb 2026)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/6-massive-challenges-bitcoin-faces-road-quantum-security-jlenc) reaches a similar conclusion. Key friction points they identify:\n- **Algorithm selection debate**: The Bitcoin community must choose between ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, FALCON, and hash-based alternatives \u2014 a contentious decision with no consensus, per [signature scheme comparison](../04-signature-schemes/comparison-matrix.md)\n- **Block size / witness discount conflict**: Any PQ opcode requires a witness discount increase that echoes the block size wars\n- **Leading figures skeptical**: Adam Back's \"20\u201340 years\" estimate and similar conservative voices reduce community urgency\n- **No compelling benefit**: Unlike SegWit (which reduced fees) or Taproot (which improved privacy), PQ migration is a pure defensive cost\n\n### 5.3 Community Disagreement on Approach\nThree fundamentally incompatible visions exist in the community:\n- **Gradualist/soft-fork camp**: BIP-360 first, algorithm later, no forced migration\n- **Urgent action camp**: Immediate hard fork to clean PQ implementation before the threat materializes\n- **Denialist camp**: Adam Back and others believe the threat is decades away; any action now is premature\n\nThis three-way split mirrors the 2015\u20132017 block size debate. Per [the soft-fork vs. hard-fork analysis](../03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md), a community split \"could slow the process for years or result in chain splitting.\"\n\n### 5.4 Technical Problems With Chosen PQ Scheme\nNIST's history with PQC includes a cautionary example: SIKE, a finalist algorithm, was broken in 2022 by a classical attack running on a standard laptop in hours. If the chosen Bitcoin PQ algorithm is similarly broken after deployment, the entire migration must restart. Per [NIST PQC Wikipedia (2025)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Post-Quantum_Cryptography_Standardization), NIST has standardized multiple algorithms specifically because of the risk that any single scheme could be compromised.\n\n### 5.5 Ecosystem Adoption Slower Than Expected\nEven after protocol activation, wallet software, hardware wallets, exchanges, and custodians must upgrade. Historical adoption curves for Bitcoin protocol changes show significant \"long tails.\" SegWit adoption did not reach 75% until several years after activation. PQ migration faces additional headwinds:\n- Hardware wallet firmware updates require user action\n- Institutional custody systems have multi-year refresh cycles\n- The Department of Defense's 2030 quantum-readiness deadline applies to US government systems, not Bitcoin's global user base\n\n---\n\n## 6. Risk Factors That Could Narrow the Gap\n\n### 6.1 Quantum Progress Slower Than Projected\nThe engineering challenges of scaling below-threshold error correction to millions of qubits remain formidable. As [CoinShares (Feb 2026)](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/) notes, \"some analyses project 10\u201320 years\" for a CRQC. If Microsoft's Majorana approach or other novel architectures face unexpected obstacles, T_quantum could slip to 2040+, providing time for Bitcoin's gradual migration.\n\n### 6.2 Bitcoin Community Mobilizes Quickly Under Credible Evidence\nThe Chaincode Labs paper explicitly recommends a \"dual-track strategy\": a **2-year emergency contingency** (minimal viable PQ output type) and a **7-year comprehensive path**. If the community adopts this framework, a minimal-viable emergency deployment could be activated within 2 years of demonstrated credible threat, providing temporary protection while full migration proceeds. The existence of BIP-360 (already merged) provides a pre-positioned mechanism.\n\n### 6.3 Regulatory Pressure Accelerates Industry Action\nThe U.S. Department of Defense's 2030 quantum-readiness deadline, NSA's CNSA 2.0 framework, and NIST's 2030/2035 deprecation schedule create institutional pressure that could cascade to exchanges and custodians. If major custodians (Coinbase, Fidelity, BlackRock's ETF) demand quantum-resistant Bitcoin addresses for compliance purposes, this creates bottom-up economic pressure for protocol activation.\n\n### 6.4 Address Restriction Soft Fork as Interim Solution\nAn interim soft fork that simply **prohibits new vulnerable output types** \u2014 without migrating existing UTXOs \u2014 could stop the accumulation of new risk while full migration is planned. Lopp's \"Phase A\" (prohibiting new P2PK, P2PKH, P2TR outputs) would be achievable faster than full PQ migration and would stop the problem from growing larger. Per [bitcoin-migration-timeline.md](./bitcoin-migration-timeline.md), this is the least controversial element of the multi-phase proposal.\n\n---\n\n## 7. The \"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later\" Dimension\n\nThe gap analysis above focuses on T_quantum \u2014 the date at which a CRQC becomes capable of real-time attacks. But a subtler and more immediate threat is **harvest now, decrypt later (HNDL)**: adversaries collecting and storing on-chain public key data today, with the intention of deriving private keys once a CRQC exists.\n\nFor Bitcoin, this is not theoretical. **Every public key ever revealed on the Bitcoin blockchain is permanently recorded** and trivially accessible. The HNDL threat means:\n\n- The \"harvest\" phase **has already occurred and is ongoing for all P2PK and address-reused outputs**\n- No protocol change can retroactively protect these exposed keys\n- The effective \"compromise date\" for these outputs is not T_quantum but **the date the harvesting actor first achieves CRQC capability** \u2014 which may remain private for months or years after the fact\n\nMajor cybersecurity agencies explicitly base their PQC guidance on the HNDL threat:\n- **U.S. Department of Homeland Security, UK NCSC, ENISA, Australian Cyber Security Centre**: All assume adversaries are currently collecting encrypted data, per [Freshfields Quantum Disentangled (Dec 2025)](https://technologyquotient.freshfields.com/post/102lx4l/quantum-disentangled-1-harvest-now-decrypt-later-the-quantum-threat-is-alr)\n\nFor Bitcoin specifically, HNDL changes the risk calculus: **the relevant question for P2PK holders is not \"when does T_quantum arrive?\" but \"when does the first state actor with a CRQC decide to exploit their capability?\"** This could occur silently, with no public announcement, while affected Bitcoin holders remain unaware their funds are compromised.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Stakeholder-Specific Risk Assessment\n\n### 8.1 Holders of P2PK UTXOs \u2014 Highest Risk\n\n**Category**: Approximately 1.72 million BTC, including Satoshi's estimated ~1.1 million BTC, held in Pay-to-Public-Key format. Public keys are permanently exposed on-chain from the time of first receipt. No user action can retroactively protect them.\n\n**Risk profile**: These outputs are **already \"harvested.\"** The only question is when a CRQC will decrypt them. Under a wide-gap scenario, these coins will be stolen by the first entity with CRQC capability, triggering the \"burn or steal\" governance crisis described in the [HRF report (Oct 2025)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/). There is no migration path without owner action \u2014 and many of these coins are demonstrably lost (Satoshi, early miners who are deceased or have lost keys).\n\n**Recommendation**: Protocol-level decision required (freeze, burn, or allow theft). Cannot be solved at the individual holder level.\n\n### 8.2 Holders With Address Reuse \u2014 High Risk\n\n**Category**: Approximately 4.49\u20134.79 million BTC in P2PKH, P2SH, and Taproot addresses that have been spent from at least once, exposing their public keys.\n\n**Risk profile**: Public keys are exposed but holders still control their private keys. These coins **can be migrated** if holders take action. Under a narrow-gap scenario, motivated holders who migrate before T_quantum are protected. Under a wide-gap scenario, holders who delay may find their funds stolen.\n\n**Actionable advice (today)**: Move coins to a new P2WPKH or P2TR address that has never been spent from. This does not provide quantum resistance but removes the long-exposure attack surface for all currently-deployed hardware, since the public key is not revealed until the next spend.\n\n**Future action**: Once BIP-360 is activated, migrate to P2MR address format. Once PQ signature opcode is activated, use full quantum-resistant output type.\n\n### 8.3 Holders Using Current Best Practices \u2014 Lower Risk\n\n**Category**: Holders using P2WPKH (native SegWit) or P2TR (Taproot) addresses **that have never been spent from**, practicing address non-reuse.\n\n**Risk profile**: Public keys are **not** currently exposed on-chain. These outputs are vulnerable to short-exposure attacks during the ~10-minute mempool window \u2014 requiring a CRQC to break ECDSA in under 10 minutes. Per [Webber et al. (2022)](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/physics/iqt/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Webber-2022.pdf), a 10-minute attack requires ~1.9 billion physical qubits \u2014 far beyond any plausible near-term system. This attack surface only becomes relevant for the most advanced CRQC systems, likely post-2040.\n\n**These holders have more time to wait for protocol-level quantum resistance to be deployed.**\n\n### 8.4 Exchanges and Custodians \u2014 Systemic Risk\n\n**Category**: Exchanges and custodians collectively hold hundreds of billions in Bitcoin. Many have practiced address reuse (cold wallets repeatedly receiving to the same address) or use multisig configurations where public keys are exposed.\n\n**Risk profile**: [Murmuration II (Nov 2025)](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-and-the-quantum-problem-part-47f) specifically identifies Binance's cold wallet (34xp4vRoCGJym3xR7yCVPFHoCNxv4Twseo) with ~248,000 BTC and an exposed public key as \"the biggest prize\" for a CRQC attacker. A single large-exchange theft could trigger systemic contagion across the entire ecosystem.\n\nRegulatory pressure is also acute: **Coinbase formally acknowledged quantum computing as a long-term risk** and has assembled expert groups; Jefferies removed Bitcoin from its model portfolio in January 2026 specifically citing cryptographic concerns. The DoD's 2030 quantum-readiness deadline applies to financial institutions holding government assets.\n\n### 8.5 The Satoshi Coins Question \u2014 Existential Dilemma\n\nThe approximately 1.1 million BTC in Satoshi Nakamoto's P2PK addresses represent an unresolved governance problem with no clean solution:\n\n- **Allow theft**: A CRQC actor steals ~$100+ billion in BTC, destabilizing the market and violating the property rights of the original holder\n- **Freeze without recovery mechanism**: ~1.1M BTC permanently frozen; market cap reduced but ecosystem protected from theft\n- **ZK-proof recovery**: Ethereum's approach \u2014 freeze coins, allow recovery via zero-knowledge proof of seed phrase possession \u2014 but early Bitcoin addresses predate BIP-39 seed phrases entirely, making this approach inapplicable for the oldest coins\n\nThe [LinkedIn analysis (Feb 2026)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/6-massive-challenges-bitcoin-faces-road-quantum-security-jlenc) frames the community tension: \"By implementing a freeze, are we protecting Bitcoin's value, or are we destroying its core promise of immutability? If the network can freeze 25% of the supply to 'save' it, where does that level of control end?\"\n\nThis is not a technical question \u2014 it is a philosophical and political one that Bitcoin's community must answer under time pressure.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Summary Risk Matrix\n\n| Stakeholder | Current Exposure | Migration Path | Risk Level | Priority |\n|-------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|----------|\n| P2PK holders (1.72M BTC) | Already exposed (keys on-chain) | Requires owner action; many coins lost | **Critical** | Emergency |\n| Address-reuse P2PKH (4.5M BTC) | Keys exposed after first spend | Migrate to new address; then to P2MR | **High** | Urgent |\n| Large exchanges/custodians | Varies; many exposed keys | Custodial system upgrade; regulatory push | **High** | Urgent |\n| Current best-practice holders (P2WPKH/P2TR, no reuse) | Keys not yet exposed | Wait for BIP-360; migrate before Q-Day | **Moderate** | Planned |\n| Lightning Network channels (P2TR) | Keys in channel scripts | Protocol-level solution needed | **Moderate** | Planned |\n| Mining (SHA-256 PoW) | Not vulnerable to Shor's algorithm | No migration required for mining | **Low** | Monitor |\n| Satoshi's 1.1M BTC (P2PK) | Permanently exposed; keys on-chain | Community governance decision required | **Existential** | Unresolved |\n\n---\n\n*Sources: [Chaincode Labs paper (May 2025)](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf), [Forbes BIP-360 (Feb 2026)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/), [Citi Institute (Jan 2026)](https://postquantum.com/security-pqc/citi-quantum-threat-report/), [JBBA hybrid PQ paper (Dec 2025)](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf), [Murmuration II (Nov 2025)](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-and-the-quantum-problem-part-47f), [Freshfields HNDL analysis (Dec 2025)](https://technologyquotient.freshfields.com/post/102lx4l/quantum-disentangled-1-harvest-now-decrypt-later-the-quantum-threat-is-alr), [Webber et al.

Why ECDSA-256 Is an Easier Target Than RSA-2048\n\nBefore laying out the timeline, a foundational asymmetry must be stated: **breaking Bitcoin's ECDSA-256 is a smaller computational problem than breaking RSA-2048**, and it will therefore be achieved first. This distinction is critical for interpreting quantum computing milestones.\n\n[Proos & Zalka (2003)](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301141) established that 160-bit ECC requires fewer qubits to break than 1,024-bit RSA. [R\u00f6tteler et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-70697-9_9) refined this to approximately **2,330 logical qubits** for P-256/secp256k1, compared to roughly 4,000+ logical qubits for RSA-3072 (comparable classical security). The key finding from [the academic synthesis in this corpus](../02-academic-research/key-findings-synthesis.md): Bitcoin's ECDSA will be compromised before most RSA-protected internet infrastructure, all else being equal.\n\nThis means company roadmaps and academic estimates targeting RSA-2048 should be understood as **upper bounds** for the Bitcoin threat \u2014 the actual CRQC for Bitcoin will arrive earlier.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Published Roadmaps by Company\n\n### IBM\nIBM's roadmap is the industry's most detailed public forecast, updated June 2025:\n- **Nighthawk (2025)**: 120 qubits, improved coupling, 5,000-gate depth; scales to 3 linked chips (360 qubits) in 2026 and 9 chips (1,080 qubits) by 2027\n- **Kookaburra (2026)**: First fault-tolerant module with logic and memory integration\n- **Cockatoo (2027)**: Inter-module entanglement via l-couplers\n- **Starling (2029)**: 200 logical qubits, 100M quantum gates; IBM's first large-scale fault-tolerant machine, to be housed at a new Poughkeepsie, NY data center \u2014 [IBM roadmap update, Jun 2025](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/ibm-updates-quantum-computing-roadmap-to-deliver-starling-system-by-2029/)\n- **Blue Jay (2033+)**: 2,000 logical qubits, 1 billion gates \u2014 IBM's own website identifies this as the system that will \"unlock the full power of quantum computing,\" with 2,000 logical qubits described as sufficient to break ECDSA-256\n\nIBM uses quantum LDPC codes targeting a 12:1 physical-to-logical qubit ratio at 99.99% fidelity, reducing the qubits needed for ECDSA-256 to approximately 28,000\u201377,000 physical qubits.\n\n### Google\nGoogle has completed Milestones 1 (quantum supremacy, 2019) and 2 (error correction prototype, 2023) of a 6-milestone roadmap. With Willow, it progressed toward Milestone 3 (long-lived logical qubit with <1 error per 1M operations). Google's stated goal is \"a useful, error-corrected quantum computer by 2029,\" per [The Quantum Insider, May 2025](https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/05/16/quantum-computing-roadmaps-a-look-at-the-maps-and-predictions-of-major-quantum-players/). Google acquired Atlantic Quantum (MIT spinout specializing in fluxonium qubits) in 2025, signaling investment in next-generation qubit designs.\n\n### IonQ\nIonQ's revised roadmap (post-Oxford Ionics acquisition, June 2025):\n- **2026**: 256-qubit prototype\n- **2028**: 1,600 logical qubits / 20,000 physical qubits\n- **2029**: 8,000 logical qubits / 200,000 physical qubits \u2014 **exceeds the ECDSA-256 threshold of ~2,330 logical qubits**\n- **2030**: 80,000 logical qubits / 2,000,000 physical qubits\n\nPer [Tom's Hardware, Feb 2026](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/the-future-of-quantum-computing-the-tech-companies-and-roadmaps-that-map-out-a-coherent-quantum-future), IonQ considers its architecture \"the most scaling-friendly available\" due to the microwave control replacing laser systems.\n\n### Quantinuum\nQuantinuum's Apollo system targets \"universal, fault-tolerant quantum computing by 2030,\" per [The Quantum Insider, May 2025](https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/05/16/quantum-computing-roadmaps-a-look-at-the-maps-and-predictions-of-major-quantum-players/). The Helios roadmap (2025): 98 physical / 48 logical qubits. Apollo (2030): Full fault-tolerant gate set at scale. The trajectory from 12 logical qubits (2024) to 48 (2025) implies rough doubling every 12\u201318 months.\n\n### Microsoft (Majorana)\nMicrosoft's topological qubit approach via Majorana 1 (Feb 2025) promises inherent error protection at the hardware level, potentially requiring far fewer physical qubits per logical qubit than superconducting approaches. Microsoft claims a path to 1 million qubits on a hand-sized chip, per [Microsoft blog, Feb 2025](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2025/02/19/introducing-microsofts-majorana-1-chip/). CEO Satya Nadella stated this will produce a \"truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, but in years.\" However, the technology remains at basic research level; commercialization is likely post-2035 per [LinkedIn Quantum Roadmap 2026, Feb 2026](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-hype-hard-deadlines-quantum-computing-roadmap-bellinghausen--nadkf).\n\n### Amazon (Ocelot)\nAmazon's Ocelot chip (March 2025) uses cat qubit architecture to reduce error correction overhead by up to 90%. AWS director Oskar Painter stated Ocelot \"could accelerate our timeline to a practical quantum computer by up to five years,\" per [InfoQ, Mar 2025](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/03/aws-ocelot-quantum-chip/). Amazon has not published a specific roadmap timeline.\n\n### PsiQuantum\nPsiQuantum targets a 1-million-qubit, fault-tolerant photonic system, with datacenters announced in Brisbane and Chicago. After a $1B Series E raise in 2025, PsiQuantum has announced intent to deliver a commercial-grade quantum computer \"by the end of 2027,\" a target that observers consider aspirational, with 2028\u20132030 more likely. DARPA selected PsiQuantum for US2QC Stage B in 2025, providing government validation of the photonic approach, per [PostQuantum.com, May 2025](https://postquantum.com/quantum-computing-companies/psiquantum/).\n\n---\n\n## 4. CRQC Timeline Estimates: Expert and Institutional Forecasts\n\n### Optimistic (2027\u20132030)\n\n- **Vitalik Buterin (2025)**: Warned ECC \"could end up being compromised by quantum computing before 2028,\" per [Quantum Zeitgeist, Feb 2026](https://quantumzeitgeist.com/quantum-computing-companies-in-2026-2/)\n- **Dallaire-Demers, Doyle & Foo (2025)**: Extrapolate the \"challenge ladder\" of falling physical qubit requirements vs. rising hardware capabilities; project \"first intersections between 2027 and 2033,\" with earliest possible intersection around 2027, per [Murmuration II, Nov 2025](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-and-the-quantum-problem-part-47f)\n- **Quantum Doomsday Clock**: Projects quantum machines capable of breaking encryption by March 2028\n- **IonQ roadmap (if met)**: 8,000 logical qubits by 2029\n\n### Moderate (2030\u20132035)\n\n- **DARPA / Dr. Joe Altepeter (2025)**: Fault-tolerant quantum prototype by 2027; scientific utility 2030\u20132032; industrial utility as early as 2034, per [Murmuration II, Nov 2025](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-and-the-quantum-problem-part-47f)\n- **Metaculus prediction platform (Nov 2025)**: RSA factoring via Shor's algorithm expected by **2034** \u2014 a revision of ~20 years earlier than the previous forecast of 2052, per [BeInCrypto, Nov 2025](https://beincrypto.com/quantum-computing-cryptography-timeline-2034/)\n- **Kalshi prediction market (cited by Citi, Jan 2026)**: ~8% of respondents expect a useful QC by 2027; **39% by 2030; just over 50% by 2035**, per [PostQuantum.com, Feb 2026](https://postquantum.com/security-pqc/citi-quantum-threat-report/)\n- **NIST**: Recommends deprecating ECDSA and RSA after 2030; full prohibition by 2035 \u2014 reflecting expectation of viable CRQC by mid-2030s\n- **IBM Blue Jay (2033)**: Own roadmap places ~2,000 logical qubits in 2033 \u2014 near but not clearly over the ECDSA-256 threshold\n\n### Conservative (2035\u20132050)\n\n- **Global Risk Institute (GRI)**: 19\u201334% probability of CRQC by 2034; 60\u201382% by 2044, per [Citi Institute report, Jan 2026](https://postquantum.com/security-pqc/citi-quantum-threat-report/)\n- **CoinShares (Feb 2026)**: \"Some analyses projecting 10\u201320 years\" for a CRQC, per [CoinShares](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/)\n- **Adam Back**: Estimates \"20\u201340 years\" from now\n- **Webber et al. (2022)**: \"Will not happen within the next decade,\" implying no earlier than ~2032\n\n### Summary Probability Table (as of early 2026)\n\n| Date | CRQC Capable of Breaking ECDSA-256 | Source |\n|------|------------------------------------|----|\n| 2028 | ~5\u201310% (tail risk) | Dallaire-Demers extrapolation lower bound |\n| 2030 | ~39% (prediction market) | Kalshi survey cited by Citi |\n| 2033\u20132034 | ~50% (median estimate) | Metaculus; IBM Blue Jay roadmap |\n| 2035 | >50% (industry consensus) | NIST deprecation deadline basis |\n| 2044 | 60\u201382% | Global Risk Institute |\n\n---\n\n## 5. The Algorithmic Improvement Trajectory\n\nA critical dimension is that resource requirements for quantum cryptanalysis have fallen by **four orders of magnitude** between 2010 and 2025, per [Dallaire-Demers et al. (2025)](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-and-the-quantum-problem-part-47f):\n\n- **2012 estimate**: ~1 billion qubits for RSA-2048 break\n- **2019 (Gidney & Eker\u00e5)**: ~20 million qubits for RSA-2048 in 8 hours\n- **2023 (Litinski)**: 6.9 million qubits for 10-minute ECDSA-256 break\n- **2025 (Gidney)**: <1 million qubits for RSA-2048 in ~1 week \u2014 a 20\u00d7 reduction from 2019, per [The Quantum Insider, May 2025](https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/05/24/google-researcher-lowers-quantum-bar-to-crack-rsa-encryption/)\n\nThe rate of algorithmic improvement means that **projections based on 2022 or earlier resource estimates are almost certainly too pessimistic** about when a CRQC could emerge. The [PostQuantum.com analysis of Gidney's paper](https://postquantum.com/quantum-research/quantum-breakthrough-rsa-2048/) notes: \"Don't assume 'too many qubits required' will hold true for long. As Gidney wryly notes, every encryption scheme eventually faces better attacks; quantum RSA-breaking is following that rule.\"\n\nFor ECDSA-256 specifically, Dallaire-Demers et al. estimate the required physical qubit count at **100,000\u20131,000,000** \u2014 \"only two to three orders of magnitude away\" from today's largest systems.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Projected Milestone Timeline: Forward-Looking\n\n| Year | Projected Milestone | Most Likely Actor | ECDSA-256 Risk Level |\n|------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|\n| 2026 | IonQ 256-qubit prototype | IonQ | Negligible |\n| 2027 | DARPA fault-tolerant prototype | US government ecosystem | Negligible |\n| 2028 | IBM Starling pre-release; IonQ ~1,600 logical qubits | IBM, IonQ | Theoretical (early risk window opens) |\n| 2029 | IBM Starling: 200 logical qubits; IonQ target 8,000 logical qubits | IBM, IonQ | Low-to-moderate if IonQ roadmap holds |\n| 2030 | Quantinuum Apollo: fault-tolerant system; PsiQuantum delivery (aspirational) | Multiple | Moderate; 39% prediction market probability |\n| 2033 | IBM Blue Jay: ~2,000 logical qubits (near ECDSA-256 threshold) | IBM | High |\n| 2033\u20132035 | CRQC for ECDSA-256 with high probability | Unknown leader | Critical threshold |\n\nNote: IonQ's 2029 projection of 8,000 logical qubits would cross the ECDSA-256 threshold. However, IonQ's roadmap represents one of the most ambitious projections in the industry and assumes successful integration of Oxford Ionics IP, photonic interconnects, and multiple unproven scaling steps.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Caveats and Uncertainty Factors\n\n1. **Classified capabilities**: Nation-state programs (US, China, Russia) may be significantly ahead of public disclosure. Some physicists assign a \"low but nonzero probability\" that a CRQC already exists covertly, per [Murmuration II, Nov 2025](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-and-the-quantum-problem-part-47f).\n\n2. **Error correction scaling**: Google's Willow demonstrated below-threshold behavior at 105 qubits. Scaling this to millions of qubits while maintaining below-threshold performance has never been attempted and faces formidable engineering challenges.\n\n3. **Roadmaps are aspirational**: IBM has historically met its near-term roadmap targets. IonQ's million-qubit projection for 2030 is far more speculative.\n\n4. **Microsoft Majorana uncertainty**: The topological qubit approach could be transformative or could face unknown obstacles \u2014 currently \"20\u201330 years behind\" more mature platforms at the qubit-operation level per some estimates.\n\n5. **Algorithmic improvement continues**: A repeat of Gidney's 20\u00d7 reduction would bring CRQC requirements well within IBM's current architecture.\n\n---\n\n*Sources: [Google Willow](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/), [IBM roadmap](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/ibm-updates-quantum-computing-roadmap-to-deliver-starling-system-by-2029/), [Gidney 2025](https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/05/24/google-researcher-lowers-quantum-bar-to-crack-rsa-encryption/), [Tom's Hardware 2026](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/the-future-of-quantum-computing-the-tech-companies-and-roadmaps-that-map-out-a-coherent-quantum-future), [Metaculus prediction](https://beincrypto.com/quantum-computing-cryptography-timeline-2034/), [Kalshi / Citi](https://postquantum.com/security-pqc/citi-quantum-threat-report/), [NIST PQC](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/03/nist-selects-hqc-fifth-algorithm-post-quantum-encryption), [Quantum Hardware Status](../01-threat-model/quantum-hardware-status.md), [Key Findings Synthesis](../02-academic-research/key-findings-synthesis.md)*\n",
  "08-community-sentiment/conference-talks": "# Bitcoin Quantum Computing: Conference Talks and Podcast Appearances\n\n\n> **Last updated:** February 28, 2026 | **Confidence shelf-life:** 1 year (talks are historical record)\n\n\n**Compiled:** 2026-02-28  \n**Sources:** YouTube, Apple Podcasts, conference websites, Bitcoin Magazine, Stephan Livera Podcast, What Bitcoin Did  \n**Methodology:** Searched for talks at Bitcoin conferences (MIT Bitcoin Expo, Bitcoin 2024/2025, Advancing Bitcoin), cryptography conferences (Real World Crypto, ETSI/IQC), and major podcasts (What Bitcoin Did, Stephan Livera, Coin Stories). Cross-referenced developers/researchers mentioned in ../06-people-and-orgs/key-researchers.md (anticipated file).\n\n---\n\n## Bitcoin Conferences & Expos\n\n---\n\n### Talk 1\n\n- **Speaker:** Hunter Beast (Brandon Goodell)\n- **Affiliation:** Protocol Engineer at Anduro; Project Lead at Surmount Systems; Lead author of BIP-360\n- **Talk Title:** \"Bitcoin and Quantum Computing Resistance\"\n- **Conference:** 2025 MIT Bitcoin Expo (Freedom Tech track)\n- **Date:** April 5\u20136, 2025\n- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TsVRZeyiAY (via Bitcoin Magazine YouTube, published April 7, 2025; 30:29 runtime)\n- **Summary:** The most technically rigorous public talk on Bitcoin's quantum exposure given in 2025. Hunter Beast opens with a precise explanation of how Shor's algorithm threatens the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) underlying Bitcoin's ECDSA and Schnorr signatures. Key technical distinctions: long-range attacks (targeting on-chain coins with permanently exposed public keys, especially P2PK outputs containing ~1.6\u20131.8M BTC in ~34,000 UTXOs) vs. short-range attacks (requiring a CRQC that can break a key within 10 minutes while a transaction is in the mempool \u2014 a far more powerful machine). Beast cited the NSA's CNSA 2.0 timeline (sunset EC and RSA in new systems by 2030, existing systems by 2035) as evidence the government \"must know something.\" He introduced the \"Hourglass\" proposal to rate-limit P2PK spending to one input per block, spreading quantum-theft risk over ~8 months rather than allowing simultaneous theft of all 34,000 UTXOs. He acknowledged: \"This is not something we can fix overnight. It will take a lot of time. It's an immense coordination problem.\"\n- **Position:** Moderate-urgent. Quantum is a real future threat requiring proactive preparation now; no immediate panic warranted, but the window to prepare is narrowing.\n\n---\n\n### Talk 2\n\n- **Speaker:** Hunter Beast + Shinobi (Bitcoin Magazine Technical Editor)\n- **Affiliation:** Hunter Beast (Anduro/Surmount Systems); Shinobi (Bitcoin Magazine)\n- **Talk Title:** \"Solving Bitcoin's Quantum Computing Threat: BIP 360 With Hunter Beast\"\n- **Conference:** 2025 MIT Bitcoin Expo (panel/interview format)\n- **Date:** May 13, 2025 (published to YouTube)\n- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NoJnPmCVdU (via Bitcoin Magazine, 16:44 runtime); also https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1922441109533311101\n- **Summary:** A companion interview to the formal talk above, with Bitcoin Magazine editor Shinobi. Hunter Beast explains BIP-360's multi-signature quantum-resistant upgrade allowing wallets to combine three post-quantum signature algorithms (NIST-standardized) for transaction authorization. He details the difference between physical qubits (today's noisy hardware) and logical qubits (the error-corrected units needed for Shor's algorithm). Key figures: ~2,000\u20133,000 logical qubits needed for a practical attack (thresholds to watch in hardware news); current hardware is ~100,000\u00d7 below this. Beast also discusses the game-theoretic concern that access to CRQCs will likely be restricted to large institutional players \u2014 meaning the attacker will likely be a state actor or major corporation, not an independent hacker. Shinobi stated he \"personally\" prefers the Hourglass approach over burning coins preemptively.\n- **Position:** Pragmatic urgency. BIP-360 is a necessary first step; full quantum resistance requires sustained community consensus-building over years.\n\n---\n\n### Talk 3\n\n- **Speaker:** Presenters at Presidio Bitcoin Quantum Summit\n- **Affiliation:** Multiple Bitcoin developers and quantum researchers (summit described as bringing together \"well-known Bitcoin developer researcher types... along with some quantum people\")\n- **Talk Title:** Presidio Bitcoin Quantum Summit (multi-speaker summit)\n- **Conference:** Presidio Bitcoin Quantum Summit\n- **Date:** July 2025\n- **URL:** Referenced by Stephan Livera and Matt Corallo in SLP719 (https://stephanlivera.com/episode/719/); no public recording confirmed\n- **Summary:** A closed or semi-private summit that brought together Bitcoin Core developers, cryptographers, and quantum computing experts to assess the timeline and technical requirements for a CRQC. The summit is described by Matt Corallo as an important milestone in developers \"taking quantum seriously.\" The existence and content of the summit was discussed publicly by Corallo and Livera on the Stephan Livera Podcast (SLP719, February 11, 2026). No public recordings or transcripts have been identified; the summit appears to have shaped Corallo's \"Quantum Plan\" proposal (Tapscript leaf approach).\n- **Position:** Moderate preparedness. The summit's consensus reportedly was that the threat is real but distant enough to allow for careful, non-emergency planning.\n\n---\n\n## Podcasts\n\n---\n\n### Talk 4\n\n- **Speaker:** Brandon Black (Bitcoin software engineer)\n- **Affiliation:** Bitcoin Core contributor; independent developer\n- **Talk Title:** \"The Quantum Computing Myth\"\n- **Conference/Podcast:** What Bitcoin Did (with Danny Knowles)\n- **Date:** February 3, 2026\n- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZZkQRqnNE4 (YouTube, 60:54 runtime); https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-truth-about-quantum-computing-bitcoin-brandon-black/id1482455669?i=1000747857495\n- **Summary:** Brandon Black argues that quantum computing is \"unlikely to threaten Bitcoin in the foreseeable future\" and that exaggerated claims around qubit scaling and Shor's algorithm distort the real risk. The episode covers: the realities of qubit scaling (physical qubits vs. logical qubits; the exponential error-correction overhead); recent hardware \"breakthroughs\" (Google Willow) and why they don't translate to near-term ECDSA breaks; what a quantum attack on Bitcoin would actually look like (sub-10-minute key recovery needed for mempool attacks \u2014 a drastically more demanding requirement than commonly stated); the tradeoffs of post-quantum signature schemes (SPHINCS+, Dilithium, FALCON all have massive signature size increases); the governance and property rights questions around soft forks and confiscation. Black concludes that concrete evidence (not theoretical projections) should be the bar for Bitcoin to act.\n- **Position:** Skeptic/non-urgent. The quantum threat is theoretical; the hardware gap is measured in orders of magnitude; Bitcoin should not act prematurely.\n\n---\n\n### Talk 5\n\n- **Speaker:** Matt Corallo\n- **Affiliation:** Open source Bitcoin/Lightning developer at Spiral (Block Inc.); long-term Bitcoin Core contributor\n- **Talk Title:** \"What do Bitcoiners do about Quantum?\" (SLP719)\n- **Conference/Podcast:** Stephan Livera Podcast\n- **Date:** February 11, 2026\n- **URL:** https://stephanlivera.com/episode/719/\n- **Summary:** Corallo presents what became known as \"The Matt Corallo Quantum Plan\": add a Tapscript leaf to existing Taproot outputs immediately, allowing wallets to optionally commit to a hash-based post-quantum signature without a consensus change. No fees increase for users who don't adopt it; it creates an upgrade path that can later be activated by soft fork if urgency requires. Corallo's timeline: quantum threat is 10\u201325 years away per expert consensus. He argues Bitcoin developers are not ignoring the problem but are prioritizing correctly. He also discusses the burned-coin vs. quantum-theft dilemma: ZK-proof recovery (proving seed phrase ownership without revealing a private key) could enable a \"burn\" path that respects property rights for legitimate owners while blocking quantum theft. Corallo disputed Nic Carter's characterization that developers are in \"total denial.\"\n- **Position:** Moderate. Threat is real but distant; begin simple non-disruptive preparations now; avoid premature commitment to unproven PQ cryptography.\n\n---\n\n### Talk 6\n\n- **Speaker:** James O'Beirne\n- **Affiliation:** Long-time Bitcoin Core developer; creator of OP_Vault covenant proposal; semi-retired from active development\n- **Talk Title:** \"Is Quantum FUD BS?\" (SLP721)\n- **Conference/Podcast:** Stephan Livera Podcast\n- **Date:** February 14, 2026\n- **URL:** https://stephanlivera.com/episode/721/\n- **Summary:** O'Beirne takes a skeptical position, arguing that quantum computing's urgency is being weaponized as a wedge to introduce new, unvetted cryptography into Bitcoin. He frames much of the quantum discourse as creating conditions where questionable cryptographic proposals get rushed through \u2014 \"if you can convince enough people that there's reason to add this cryptography to Bitcoin, it's a very short leap to convince a similar number of people that they should encumber their coins using these schemes.\" He argues quantum doesn't \"breach the top hundred things when it comes to Bitcoin.\" He acknowledges that if institutions come to believe a quantum threat is 3 years away and \"the Bitcoin guys aren't doing anything about it,\" this creates a \"massive headwind for Bitcoin adoption\" \u2014 recognizing the narrative risk even if dismissing the technical urgency. His concern about NIST: \"NIST's push for post-quantum cryptography raises concerns about government influence.\"\n- **Position:** Skeptical/non-urgent. Quantum FUD may be more dangerous than quantum computers for Bitcoin's near-term health. Extreme caution about adding new cryptography.\n\n---\n\n### Talk 7\n\n- **Speaker:** Michael Saylor\n- **Affiliation:** Executive Chairman, Strategy (MicroStrategy); largest corporate Bitcoin holder\n- **Talk Title:** Coin Stories episode (quantum discussion segment)\n- **Conference/Podcast:** Coin Stories (hosted by Natalie Brunell)\n- **Date:** February 26, 2026\n- **URL:** Referenced at https://x.com/natbrunell/status/2027078666224853322 (clip with 137K+ impressions, 333 likes, 50 retweets); full episode via Coin Stories platforms\n- **Summary:** Saylor stated quantum computing is \"not the greatest threat to Bitcoin today\" and that \"the threat is at least a decade away\" based on what he characterized as the \"consensus among cybersecurity experts.\" He argued that when quantum threats arrive, they will affect all digital systems (banks, governments, AI) \u2014 not just Bitcoin \u2014 and that \"the crypto community will be the first to perceive the threat, and to react.\" He compared quantum fears to past cycles of Bitcoin FUD that were ultimately resolved (scaling, energy use, regulation). He said a unified global response will come when the threat becomes imminent. Natalie Brunell promoted the clip as explaining \"the actual risks to Bitcoin, and what protocol upgrades could look like.\"\n- **Position:** Dismissive/non-urgent. Quantum threat is at least a decade away; Bitcoin's developer community will adapt when necessary; near-term FUD is overblown.\n\n---\n\n### Talk 8\n\n- **Speaker:** Alex Pruden + David Gokhshtein\n- **Affiliation:** Alex Pruden, CEO of Project Eleven (quantum security startup for crypto, backed by Castle Island Ventures)\n- **Talk Title:** \"IS QUANTUM COMPUTING BITCOIN'S BIGGEST RISK?\" (The Breakdown)\n- **Conference/Podcast:** The Breakdown (hosted by David Gokhshtein)\n- **Date:** February 28, 2026\n- **URL:** https://x.com/gokhshteinclips/status/2027600145240539268 (video clip; 57 impressions)\n- **Summary:** Alex Pruden argues \"there's no reason to panic \u2014 but when quantum tech matures, today's cryptography will be challenged. It's not a short-term fear, but it may be the most important long-term security question facing Bitcoin.\" Gokhshtein asks whether quantum fears could be behind major BTC sell-offs. Pruden's position is notable as CEO of Project Eleven: he is building a business around quantum security while explicitly denying panic is warranted. This moderate framing has allowed Project Eleven to bridge the \"urgent\" and \"cautious\" camps. Project Eleven also launched the \"Q-Day Prize\" \u2014 1 BTC for the first team to break a toy version of Bitcoin's cryptography (25-bit elliptic curve key) using a quantum computer on actual hardware before April 5, 2026.\n- **Position:** Moderate. Real long-term threat requiring preparation; no panic justified today.\n\n---\n\n### Talk 9\n\n- **Speaker:** Hunter Beast + Jameson Lopp + Clara Shikhelman (panelists)\n- **Affiliation:** Hunter Beast (Anduro/Surmount); Jameson Lopp (Casa); Clara Shikhelman (Chaincode Labs head of research; co-author of Chaincode quantum report)\n- **Talk Title:** Quantum panel discussion at Bitcoin developer community (format: Presidio + Bitcoin development forums)\n- **Conference/Podcast:** Multiple forums and events, 2024\u20132025\n- **Date:** Various 2024\u20132025\n- **URL:** Chaincode report accessible at https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf; Lopp blog at https://blog.lopp.net/against-quantum-recovery-of-bitcoin/\n- **Summary:** These three researchers represent the most active cluster in Bitcoin working on quantum preparedness. Clara Shikhelman (Chaincode) co-authored the comprehensive Chaincode Labs quantum report with Anthony Milton, which remains the most cited technical document on Bitcoin's quantum exposure. Jameson Lopp has published extensively on the governance dilemma (burn vs. allow theft) and submitted a formal BIP for post-quantum migration. Hunter Beast authored BIP-360. Together they represent the \"prepare now\" wing of Bitcoin research \u2014 more technically credentialed than the VC urgency camp, but less institutionally influential than the Core maintainer hierarchy. Their collaboration on the \"PQ-Bitcoin\" project at Chaincode represents the most organized preparedness effort.\n- **Position:** Moderate-urgent. Collective view: the technical solutions exist; the governance problem is the critical bottleneck; work must begin now on both fronts.\n\n---\n\n## Cryptography / General Tech Conferences\n\n---\n\n### Talk 10\n\n- **Speaker:** Michele Mosca + multiple industry panelists\n- **Affiliation:** Michele Mosca: Institute for Quantum Computing, University of Waterloo; co-founder of evolutionQ; NIST PQC process participant\n- **Talk Title:** ETSI/IQC Quantum Safe Cryptography Conference 2025 (multi-panel)\n- **Conference:** ETSI/IQC Quantum Safe Cryptography Conference 2025\n- **Date:** June 2025\n- **URL:** https://www.etsi.org/events/2450-etsi-iqc-quantum-safe-cryptography-conference-2025\n- **Summary:** The premier annual academic/industry conference on post-quantum cryptography migration. 2025 sessions addressed: policy frameworks for quantum-safe transitions (involving EC DG CONNECT, NCSC, Monetary Authority of Singapore, European Central Bank); real-world PQC implementation by financial institutions (ING Bank, LGT Private Banking, European Central Bank's TARGET service); quantum-safe PKI migrations; GSMA Post Quantum Telco Network Task Force (chaired by IBM's Lory Thorpe). While not Bitcoin-specific, the conference represents the global institutional backdrop within which Bitcoin's quantum preparedness is being evaluated by the traditional finance sector. The publication of NIST's PQC standards in 2024 was highlighted as \"a turning point\" at the conference. Bitcoin was discussed in context of broader financial sector migration challenges.\n- **Position:** Systemic urgency. Migration to post-quantum cryptography is a global financial infrastructure imperative; institutions are moving on defined timelines (2030\u20132035 sunset of classical systems per NSA/NIST).\n\n---\n\n### Talk 11\n\n- **Speaker:** Vitalik Buterin\n- **Affiliation:** Co-founder, Ethereum Foundation\n- **Talk Title:** Devconnect Buenos Aires keynote (quantum discussion)\n- **Conference:** Devconnect Buenos Aires 2025\n- **Date:** 2025 (specific date not confirmed; referenced in multiple February 2026 sources)\n- **URL:** Referenced in https://cryptonews.com.au/news/saylor-brushes-off-quantum-fears-says-bitcoin-can-adapt-132999/\n- **Summary:** Vitalik Buterin warned at Devconnect Buenos Aires that elliptic curve cryptography could be broken \"as soon as 2028\" and encouraged others to \"transition to post-quantum cryptography by at least 2030.\" Ethereum has since formalized this urgency: the Ethereum Foundation updated its 2026 security roadmap to include post-quantum preparedness, and in January 2026, EF security researcher Justin Drake announced a dedicated Post-Quantum team, describing it as \"an inflection in the Ethereum Foundation's long-term quantum strategy.\" Buterin's statements are directly relevant to Bitcoin's debate because they represent a prominent alternative-chain leader taking the threat far more seriously and more publicly than Bitcoin Core leadership.\n- **Position:** Urgent. A CRQC capable of breaking ECC could arrive by 2028; Ethereum should be post-quantum ready by 2030. Bitcoin's comparatively slow governance process is identified as a risk factor.\n\n---\n\n### Talk 12\n\n- **Speaker:** Isaac Kim (University of California, Davis), Yuval Boger (quantum computing developer)\n- **Affiliation:** Kim: CS Professor, UC Davis; Boger: quantum computer developer featured in Forbes\n- **Talk Title:** \"Bitcoin and Quantum Computing\" (Presto Labs interview / The Week coverage)\n- **Conference/Podcast:** Presto Labs research interview; summarized in The Week (June 8, 2025)\n- **Date:** June 2025\n- **URL:** https://theweek.com/tech/bitcoin-crypto-quantum-computers-dangers\n- **Summary:** Two academic/industry voices offering a nuanced external perspective on the threat. Isaac Kim (UC Davis): \"Any blockchain that uses ECC, like bitcoin and ethereum, are vulnerable\" but \"the risk is real in the long term\" with \"immediate risks low.\" Yuval Boger (Forbes): quantum computing could \"undermine the cryptographic backbone of blockchain,\" though large-scale error-corrected machines are not yet available. The Week piece also noted a May 2025 Craig Gidney (Google Quantum AI) paper showing RSA encryption could be overcome using \"20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated\" \u2014 a significant downward revision to the hardware requirements for cryptographic attacks.\n- **Position:** Long-term threat with credible risk trajectory. The hardware gap is real but narrowing faster than standard estimates assume.\n\n---\n\n### Talk 13\n\n- **Speaker:** Clara Shikhelman + Anthony Milton\n- **Affiliation:** Chaincode Labs (Bitcoin research and development center, NYC)\n- **Talk Title:** \"Bitcoin and Quantum Computing: Current Status and Future Directions\" (Chaincode Labs research presentation)\n- **Conference:** Future of Bitcoin Conference, October 21, 2024\n- **Date:** October 21, 2024\n- **URL:** https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf (full report PDF); referenced in Chaincode report citations as \"Presentation at Future of Bitcoin Conference\"\n- **Summary:** The academic/developer report that set the terms of the Bitcoin quantum debate through 2025\u20132026. Key findings: a CRQC could enable theft of ~6.26 million BTC (~$650 billion at late 2024 prices); funds most vulnerable include large institutional holdings with address reuse and Satoshi-era P2PK UTXOs; quantum's impact on mining is limited (Grover's algorithm only provides quadratic speedup, insufficient against ASICs); a 1/3 of survey respondents in the global expert community put 50%+ odds on a CRQC capable of breaking Bitcoin's cryptography emerging by 2030\u20132035. Tim Ruffing, Jonas Nick, and Ethan Heilman are cited as leading the technical work. The dual-track proposed timeline: 2-year contingency plan + 7-year comprehensive path. The report explicitly calls this \"the most significant test of Bitcoin's decentralized governance model to date.\"\n- **Position:** Moderate-urgent. The threat window is credible; technical solutions exist; governance preparation must begin now.\n\n---\n\n### Talk 14\n\n- **Speaker:** Graham Stone + David Sencil (hosts)\n- **Affiliation:** Bitcoin.com News Media\n- **Talk Title:** \"Bitcoin's Quantum Problem Isn't Math \u2014 It's Governance\" (The Weekly, Episode)\n- **Conference/Podcast:** The Weekly (Bitcoin.com podcast)\n- **Date:** December 22, 2025\n- **URL:** https://podcast.bitcoin.com/episode/68QiQL5lgKYfS7c099ovpF/\n- **Summary:** A full-episode exploration of the governance dimension of Bitcoin's quantum challenge. Key points: Bitcoin cannot \"flip a switch\" to become post-quantum \u2014 upgrading requires years of node operator adoption, wallet software updates, and ecosystem coordination; waiting until a CRQC emerges publicly may already be too late; the controversy around Satoshi's ~1 million BTC in P2PK addresses is unresolved and politically explosive; quantum attacks may \"happen silently\" \u2014 a quantum attacker could drain addresses gradually without revealing the capability publicly, meaning \"Q-Day\" may only be recognized much later. The episode also covers Coinbase's expansion plans and stablecoin regulatory developments.\n- **Position:** Governance-urgency. The real risk is not the cryptography timeline but the governance timeline \u2014 Bitcoin may not be able to mobilize fast enough.\n\n---\n\n### Talk 15\n\n- **Speaker:** Ran Neuner (CryptoManRan)\n- **Affiliation:** Crypto Insider YouTube (1M+ subscribers); prominent South African/international crypto commentator\n- **Talk Title:** \"Bitcoin's Quantum Threat Is Real! [And It's Deeply Concerning]\"\n- **Conference/Podcast:** Crypto Insider (YouTube)\n- **Date:** January 23, 2026\n- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EjPKaijKOk (20K+ views)\n- **Summary:** A retail-facing video framing quantum computing as \"the single biggest reason for BTC's underperformance in 2026.\" Neuner argues that as of 2026, \"for the first time, the amount of time it will take to make Bitcoin quantum resistant is longer than the amount of time where we can expect the first quantum computer to come online.\" He cites institutional commentary (Christopher Wood of Jefferies removing Bitcoin allocation, citing quantum risk) and frames Google's Willow announcement (December 2024) as the turning point. He mentions Chamath Palihapitiya's \"2 to 5 year\" quantum threat timeline and Vitalik Buterin's \"could happen by around 2028\" estimate, while acknowledging skeptics like Mert. Notably, he explicitly advises viewers not to sell Bitcoin \u2014 framing this as a risk to monitor rather than an immediate crash catalyst.\n- **Position:** Urgent-concern. Quantum is real and institutional investors are pricing it in; but it remains years away; watch and prepare.\n\n---\n\n### Talk 16\n\n- **Speaker:** Alex Pruden\n- **Affiliation:** CEO, Project Eleven (post-quantum security startup for crypto; $20M Series A at $120M valuation, February 2026; backed by Castle Island Ventures / Nic Carter)\n- **Talk Title:** Q-Day Prize Announcement + Media Appearances (Unchained, The Breakdown, others)\n- **Conference/Podcast:** Multiple \u2014 Unchained podcast (with Laura Shin), The Breakdown (Gokhshtein), various media February 2026\n- **Date:** April 2025 (Q-Day Prize launch); February 2026 (media tour after $20M raise)\n- **URL:** https://x.com/gokhshteinclips/status/2027600145240539268; Project Eleven Q-Day Prize described at https://openexo.com/l/89ee421c\n- **Summary:** Project Eleven launched the \"Q-Day Prize\" in April 2025: 1 BTC for the first team to break a toy version of Bitcoin's elliptic-curve cryptography (25-bit ECC key) using Shor's algorithm on real quantum hardware by April 5, 2026. The prize is designed to create objective benchmarking of quantum computing's progress against Bitcoin's cryptographic assumptions \u2014 \"Nobody has rigorously benchmarked this threat yet.\" Pruden's media appearances consistently took the moderate position: \"no reason to panic \u2014 but when quantum tech matures, today's cryptography will be challenged.\" The Q-Day Prize deadline passed in April 2026 with no winner \u2014 evidence that even toy versions of the attack remain beyond current hardware.\n- **Position:** Moderate-urgent. The threat is real and measurable; benchmarking is needed; panic is not warranted; preparation is.\n\n---\n\n### Talk 17\n\n- **Speaker:** Stephan Livera + James O'Beirne (extended; see SLP721) + Matt Corallo (SLP719)\n- **Affiliation:** Stephan Livera Podcast (premier Bitcoin technical podcast, 400+ episodes)\n- **Talk Title:** Quantum Computing Special Series (SLP719 + SLP721)\n- **Conference/Podcast:** Stephan Livera Podcast\n- **Date:** February 11 (SLP719) + February 14 (SLP721), 2026\n- **URL:** SLP719: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/719/; SLP721: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/721/\n- **Summary:** Two back-to-back episodes representing the \"moderate\" and \"skeptical\" developer views. SLP719 (Corallo): quantum is real but distant; \"The Matt Corallo Quantum Plan\" as a low-cost preparedness path; ZK-proof recovery enables the burn path. SLP721 (O'Beirne): quantum is being used as a \"wedge\" to introduce unvetted cryptography; \"quantum doesn't even breach the top hundred things when it comes to Bitcoin\"; the narrative risk of quantum FUD may itself create a headwind for Bitcoin adoption by institutions who misread the technical timeline. Both episodes are notable for the quality of technical analysis and the divergence of conclusions among long-serving Bitcoin developers who share the same conservative epistemology.\n- **Position:** Corallo: moderate-preparatory. O'Beirne: skeptical; quantum narrative risk may exceed quantum technical risk.\n\n---\n\n*Last updated: 2026-02-28.

  "08-community-sentiment/notable-threads-and-posts": "# Bitcoin Quantum Computing: Notable Threads and Posts\n\n\n> **Last updated:** February 28, 2026 | **Confidence shelf-life:** 6 months (new discourse emerges)\n\n\n**Compiled:** 2026-02-28  \n**Sources:** X/Twitter, Reddit, BitcoinTalk, Substack, Blogs, Web  \n**Methodology:** Searched X/Twitter with queries: \"Bitcoin quantum computing,\" \"Bitcoin quantum threat,\" \"post-quantum Bitcoin,\" \"Bitcoin Shor algorithm,\" \"BIP-360 quantum,\" \"quantum safe Bitcoin.\" Web searched for Reddit discussions, blog posts, developer statements, and analysis pieces. Cross-referenced dev positions against the Murmurations II developer survey (Feb 2026).\n\n---\n\n## Category 1: \"Quantum Is an Urgent Threat\" Camp \u2014 Strongest Arguments\n\n---\n\n### Entry 1.1\n\n- **Platform:** Substack (blog)\n- **Author/Username:** Nic Carter (@nic__carter), Founding Partner, Castle Island Ventures; co-creator of coinmetrics.io; prolific Bitcoin essayist\n- **Date:** December 2025\n- **URL:** https://www.nickcarter.substack.com/ (summarized via multiple news sources; key discussion covered at https://www.htx.com/news/Bitcoin-a6ALj0Vj/ and https://forklog.com/en/adam-back-dismisses-claims-of-bitcoin-developers-ignoring-quantum-threat/)\n- **Summary:** Carter published a lengthy piece arguing that quantum computing is only an \"engineering problem\" away from breaking Bitcoin, not a physics impossibility. He contended that Bitcoin developers are in a state of strategic misjudgment \u2014 having spent a decade in fierce debates over minor issues (block size, Lightning) while displaying \"puzzling indifference\" to an existential cryptographic threat. Carter drew the comparison that past protocol upgrades (SegWit, Taproot) each took years; if a CRQC emerges with similar lead time, the Bitcoin community will not have time to react. He also warned that a rushed, panic-driven emergency fork in response to a quantum event would damage institutional trust even more severely than the attack itself. Carter disclosed his financial stake in Project Eleven (a quantum security startup) in an October 2025 Substack post.\n- **Notable Responses:** Adam Back (Blockstream CEO) publicly rebuked Carter on X, calling his posts \"uninformed noise\" that tried to \"move the market.\" Back stated developers are \"quietly doing the r&d\" while Carter makes \"loud alarms.\" Matt Corallo labeled Carter's framing as \"FUD.\" Jameson Lopp acknowledged Carter's urgency while taking a more measured position. The debate became one of the most high-profile public rifts in Bitcoin in late 2025.\n- **Source Quality:** [Industry Figure]\n\n---\n\n### Entry 1.2\n\n- **Platform:** X/Twitter\n- **Author/Username:** CryptoManRan (@CryptoManRan), YouTube channel with 1M+ subscribers; Bitcoin and crypto analyst\n- **Date:** January 23, 2026\n- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EjPKaijKOk (linked via CoinMarketCap post and directly on YouTube as \"Bitcoin's Quantum Threat Is Real!\")\n- **Summary:** In a widely-shared YouTube video, CryptoManRan (Ran Neuner) argued that quantum computing has crossed a threshold where \"the amount of time it will take to make Bitcoin quantum resistant is longer than the amount of time where we can expect the first quantum computer to come online.\" He cited the Google Willow announcement (December 2024) as the inflection point. He argued that roughly 25% of all Bitcoin in existence \u2014 including Satoshi's coins \u2014 sits in old address formats with exposed public keys, creating a potential market catastrophe. He cited institutional investors like Christopher Wood of Jefferies removing Bitcoin from model portfolios due to quantum concerns. The video received 20K+ views and framed quantum as \"the single biggest reason for BTC's underperformance in 2026.\"\n- **Notable Responses:** Widely shared; criticized by Bitcoin developers and maximalists as FUD. The core counter-argument is that the presenter conflates noisy qubits with fault-tolerant logical qubits needed for Shor's algorithm.\n- **Source Quality:** [Media]\n\n---\n\n### Entry 1.3\n\n- **Platform:** X/Twitter (original post) / multiple news aggregators\n- **Author/Username:** Ki Young-ju (@ki_young_ju), CEO of CryptoQuant; widely followed on-chain analyst\n- **Date:** February 18, 2026\n- **URL:** Quoted across multiple posts including https://x.com/BennettReg56291/status/2027590693900980276 and https://x.com/AnnaDavis331736/status/2027590563072254259\n- **Summary:** Ki Young-ju published an analysis warning that quantum computing will \"soon challenge Bitcoin's encryption security.\" He estimated that approximately 6.89 million BTC are theoretically exposed to quantum threats \u2014 one of the higher estimates in circulation. His analysis distinguishes between long-range attacks (targeting dormant on-chain coins with exposed public keys) and short-range attacks (targeting transactions in the mempool). The figure of 6.89M BTC is substantially higher than CoinShares' 1.6M\u201310,200 BTC estimate, reflecting differences in what is categorized as \"exposed.\"\n- **Notable Responses:** The figure was cited across dozens of posts as support for the \"urgent threat\" narrative. Counter-analysts noted that most of these coins are in P2PKH addresses, not P2PK, and are only briefly exposed during the transaction window \u2014 a very different risk profile.\n- **Source Quality:** [Industry Figure]\n\n---\n\n### Entry 1.4\n\n- **Platform:** X/Twitter\n- **Author/Username:** Charles Edwards (@caprioleio), Founder of Capriole Investments (digital asset investment fund)\n- **Date:** December 19, 2025\n- **URL:** Referenced in https://forklog.com/en/adam-back-dismisses-claims-of-bitcoin-developers-ignoring-quantum-threat/\n- **Summary:** Edwards warned that a quantum computer could break Bitcoin \"in just 2\u20139 years if we don't upgrade,\" specifying \"with high probability in the 4\u20135 year range.\" He declared this to be \"the timeframe all quantum technology experts converge on\" and called for Bitcoin node operators to enforce BIP-360 immediately. He also stated the industry has \"already entered the Quantum Event Horizon.\" Edwards called for Bitcoin to be quantum-ready by 2028 and projected BTC price could fall below $50,000 if the protocol is not quantum-resistant by then.\n- **Notable Responses:** Some commentators challenged his claim of expert consensus, citing the University of Waterloo's projection (RSA-2048 broken by 2052) as a more mainstream academic view. His framing of 2\u20139 years was heavily contested by Adam Back, who put the timeline at 20\u201340 years.\n- **Source Quality:** [Industry Figure]\n\n---\n\n### Entry 1.5\n\n- **Platform:** X/Twitter\n- **Author/Username:** Ethan Heilman (@ethanheilman), Bitcoin researcher; co-author of OP_CAT BIP; affiliated with BastionZero\n- **Date:** February 2025\n- **URL:** Quoted in https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-developers-are-mostly-not\n- **Summary:** Heilman stated directly: \"I strongly believe Bitcoin will need to move to PQ signatures in the near future.\" He is actively working on post-quantum signature proposals for Bitcoin and is among the minority of research-credentialed Bitcoin developers who view the threat as having real near-term policy implications. His view is grounded in cryptographic research rather than market speculation.\n- **Notable Responses:** Cited by the Murmurations II survey as a \"bright spot\" in the Bitcoin developer community \u2014 technically credible but not positioned to drive protocol changes through the Core maintainer hierarchy.\n- **Source Quality:** [Developer]\n\n---\n\n### Entry 1.6\n\n- **Platform:** Google Groups (Bitcoin-Dev mailing list)\n- **Author/Username:** Jameson Lopp (@lopp), Co-founder and CSO of Casa; long-time Bitcoin developer and cypherpunk\n- **Date:** September 15, 2025\n- **URL:** https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/CACgYNOKz07-hU+brB7NsGyD32wB6J-+O0PS1RMhCs=gWy-vNzg@mail.gmail.com\n- **Summary:** Lopp submitted a formal \"Post-Quantum Migration Proposal\" to the Bitcoin Dev mailing list (co-authored with Christian Papathanasiou, Ian Smith, Joe Ross, Steve Vaile, and Pierre-Luc Dallaire-Demers). The proposal outlines a three-phase mandatory migration: Phase A (soft fork mandating new P2QRH outputs), Phase B (deadline for legacy ECDSA/Schnorr spending, making quantum-vulnerable UTXOs unspendable), and Phase C (optional ZK-proof recovery mechanism for legacy coins). The proposal argues that approximately 25% of all Bitcoin has an exposed public key on-chain and that \"quantum attackers could compute the private key for known public keys then transfer all funds weeks or months later, in a covert bleed.\" Lopp frames quantum not as theoretical but as an ecosystem-level governance crisis.\n- **Notable Responses:** Tim Ruffing (lead Bitcoin cryptographer at Blockstream) responded critically: \"Sure, there can be risks from CRQCs. But this proposal would go the other direction, disabling important functionality and even destroying coins preemptively, in anticipation of something that may never happen.\" BitcoinTalk forum discussion (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5550298.0) noted the governance contradiction: either let quantum theft occur or engage in compulsory seizure of vulnerable coins.\n- **Source Quality:** [Developer]\n\n---\n\n## Category 2: \"Quantum Is Decades Away / Non-Issue\" Camp \u2014 Strongest Arguments\n\n---\n\n### Entry 2.1\n\n- **Platform:** X/Twitter + Blog\n- **Author/Username:** Adam Back (@adam3us), CEO of Blockstream; inventor of Hashcash (proof-of-work precursor to Bitcoin); cited in Bitcoin whitepaper\n- **Date:** December 2025 (multiple posts); December 14, 2025 (TradingView reference)\n- **URL:** https://www.tradingview.com/news/u_today:1542f539e094b:0-bitcoin-to-zero-adam-back-debunks-quantum-fud/; https://forklog.com/en/adam-back-dismisses-claims-of-bitcoin-developers-ignoring-quantum-threat/\n- **Summary:** Back has been the most prominent public voice arguing that the quantum threat to Bitcoin is 20\u201340 years away \"if ever.\" He dismisses much of the debate as FUD, distinguishing between Shor's algorithm (which targets ECDSA) and actual mining security (SHA-256, minimally affected). Back's core technical argument: early Bitcoin addresses that have never been spent haven't revealed their public keys, so even a future CRQC cannot attack them. He told CoinShares: \"Bitcoin can adopt post-quantum signatures. Schnorr signatures paved the way for more upgrades, and Bitcoin can continue evolving defensively.\" On the Back-vs-Carter conflict, Back accused Carter of making noise to \"move the market\" while \"uninformed\" \u2014 implying Carter has a financial motive (Project Eleven investment) to hype the threat.\n- **Notable Responses:** Nic Carter disputed Back's \"quiet work\" characterization, publishing a Substack post criticizing developer complacency. The debate went viral in December 2025 and was covered by CoinTelegraph, ForkLog, and numerous crypto media.\n- **Source Quality:** [Developer]\n\n---\n\n### Entry 2.2\n\n- **Platform:** Substack (blog)\n- **Author/Username:** Murmurations II (anonymous analyst with demonstrated Bitcoin developer network access)\n- **Date:** February 4, 2026\n- **URL:** https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-developers-are-mostly-not\n- **Summary:** This detailed survey post ranked Bitcoin developers by influence and assembled direct quotes about their quantum positions. The key finding: virtually all top-tier Core maintainers \u2014 including Pieter Wuille (most influential dev; author of Taproot, SegWit, libsecp256k1), Gloria Zhao, Mara van der Laan, Greg Maxwell, and Andrew Poelstra \u2014 have either never publicly commented on quantum risk or explicitly view it as distant or speculative. Peter Todd and Adam Back \"explicitly deny feasibility or relevance.\" Luke Dashjr stated in December 2025: \"Quantum isn't a real threat. Bitcoin has much bigger problems to address.\" The post concluded: \"Among the developers who actually matter for protocol changes, quantum is viewed as theoretical, distant, or speculative, not as a live engineering problem.\"\n- **Notable Responses:** Matt Corallo disputed the characterization, calling himself \"labeled as not caring\" unfairly. The post was shared widely among Bitcoin developers and sparked defensive rebuttals from Corallo and others. Lopp and Hunter Beast acknowledged the gap between researcher urgency and Core developer apathy.\n- **Source Quality:** [Community Member / Researcher]\n\n---\n\n### Entry 2.3\n\n- **Platform:** X/Twitter\n- **Author/Username:** Pieter Wuille (@pwuille), most influential active Bitcoin Core developer; author of Taproot, SegWit, BIP340 (Schnorr), libsecp256k1\n- **Date:** February 2025\n- **URL:** Quoted at https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-developers-are-mostly-not and https://blog.lopp.net/against-quantum-recovery-of-bitcoin/\n- **Summary:** Wuille stated in February 2025: \"I certainly agree there is no urgency right now, but if (and only if) cryptography-breaking QCs become a reality, the ecosystem has no choice but disabling the spending of coins through schemes that become broken, and needs to have done so before such a machine exists.\" He acknowledges the theoretical future problem but offers no timeline urgency. In a separate statement (also quoted by Lopp), Wuille argued that if quantum theft becomes possible, even owners who have migrated to PQ addresses would be harmed by the market effect: \"I cannot see how the currency can maintain any value at all in such a setting.\" Wuille engages in technical discussions but has taken no action position.\n- **Notable Responses:** His quote on freezing vulnerable coins was cited by Lopp in support of the burn/freeze proposal \u2014 a case of Wuille's words being used in a context he has not explicitly endorsed.\n- **Source Quality:** [Developer]\n\n---\n\n### Entry 2.4\n\n- **Platform:** X/Twitter\n- **Author/Username:** Yan Pritzker (@skwp), Co-founder and CTO of Swan Bitcoin; author of \"Inventing Bitcoin\"\n- **Date:** February 27, 2026\n- **URL:** https://x.com/skwp/status/2027396251562414242\n- **Summary:** A widely-shared educational thread distinguishing what is safe from what is at risk. Safe: Bitcoin's 21 million supply cap (enforced by consensus, not cryptography); coins in addresses you never spent from (public key not revealed). At risk: coins in P2PK address types (early Satoshi-era); coins you've spent from (public key revealed). Pritzker argued that the widespread fear conflates multiple threat categories and that most Bitcoin held with standard modern practices is not exposed. The thread had 64 likes and 16 retweets and was reshared by multiple prominent Bitcoin accounts.\n- **Notable Responses:** Positive reception from Bitcoin maxis. Critics noted the thread doesn't address the risk to 6M+ BTC in legacy address types.\n- **Source Quality:** [Industry Figure]\n\n---\n\n### Entry 2.5\n\n- **Platform:** BitcoinTalk Forum\n- **Author/Username:** Macadonian (Senior Member, 2019-era forum user)\n- **Date:** June 23, 2019 (seminal early thread)\n- **URL:** https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5157696.0\n- **Summary:** A detailed early-era thread titled \"I don't believe Quantum Computing will ever threaten Bitcoin\" arguing that: (1) D-Wave quantum annealers are irrelevant to breaking ECDSA (fundamentally different architecture); (2) quantum computers that could threaten ECDSA would require 1,500+ logical qubits; (3) Bitcoin can change its cryptographic algorithm by consensus before quantum becomes practical; (4) the \"code can always stay ahead of the hardware.\" The thread represents foundational community skepticism that persists to the present day. Multiple respondents added that Bremermann's limit (physical information-theoretic constraints on computation) suggests true threat is physically impossible.\n- **Notable Responses:** arcmetal (forum respondent) agreed: \"Correct. I don't believe I'll see, in my lifetime, a so called quantum computer big enough to take down bitcoin in its current state.\" Multiple participants debated the D-Wave distinction and qubit scaling timelines.\n- **Source Quality:** [Community Member]\n\n---\n\n### Entry 2.6\n\n- **Platform:** X/Twitter\n- **Author/Username:** Michael Saylor (@saylor), Executive Chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy); largest corporate Bitcoin holder\n- **Date:** February 26, 2026 (Coin Stories podcast appearance)\n- **URL:** https://x.com/CoinMarketCap/status/2026985388737175953; https://cryptonews.com.au/news/saylor-brushes-off-quantum-fears-says-bitcoin-can-adapt-132999/\n- **Summary:** Saylor stated on the Coin Stories podcast (hosted by Natalie Brunell) that quantum computing is \"not the greatest threat to Bitcoin today,\" and that the threat is \"at least a decade away\" based on \"consensus among cybersecurity experts.\" He compared quantum fears to past Bitcoin FUD cycles (energy, scaling, regulation) that were ultimately resolved. He argued that Bitcoin's crypto community is \"the most sophisticated cybersecurity community\" and will lead adoption of post-quantum standards if and when the threat arrives. Saylor also said a unified response will only come when the threat is clearly imminent, at which point \"the entire world\" will act quickly.\n- **Notable Responses:** The CoinMarketCap tweet was retweeted 65+ times and received 308 likes. Critics noted Saylor has enormous financial incentive to downplay threats. Kevin O'Leary (Shark Tank) simultaneously disclosed quantum concerns were \"preventing institutions from allocating more than 3%\" to Bitcoin.\n- **Source Quality:** [Industry Figure]\n\n---\n\n## Category 3: \"Prepare Now, But Don't Panic\" Camp \u2014 Moderate Positions\n\n---\n\n### Entry 3.1\n\n- **Platform:** Substack\n- **Author/Username:** Clara Shikhelman + Anthony Milton, Chaincode Labs (Bitcoin research non-profit)\n- **Date:** Late 2024 / May 2025 (published in PDF form)\n- **URL:** https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf\n- **Summary:** The Chaincode Labs report \"Bitcoin and Quantum Computing: Current Status and Future Directions\" is the most comprehensive neutral technical assessment of the threat. Key findings: a CRQC could theoretically enable theft of ~6.26 million BTC worth ~$650B; roughly 1/3 of expert survey respondents give 50%+ odds of a CRQC capable of breaking Bitcoin's cryptography by 2030\u20132035; the most vulnerable funds are large institutional/exchange holdings with address-reuse practices plus Satoshi-era P2PK addresses. The paper proposes a dual-track response: 2-year contingency plan (quickly deployable if a CRQC emerges) and a 7-year comprehensive path to optimal quantum resistance. Tim Ruffing, Jonas Nick, and Ethan Heilman are noted as key contributors to Bitcoin's quantum readiness work. The report explicitly frames this as \"the most significant test of Bitcoin's decentralized governance model to date.\"\n- **Notable Responses:** CoinShares' Christopher Bendiksen directly disputed the report's 20\u201350% vulnerability figure, calling it a conflation of different threat categories.

He posits: \"Quantum recovered coins only make everyone else's coins worth less. Think of it as a theft from everyone.\" He argues the only logically consistent position for a Bitcoin property-rights maximalist is to support burning vulnerable coins, because allowing quantum actors to \"find\" private keys destroys the foundational security premise. Lopp acknowledges quantum may never materialize, but argues the asymmetric risk justifies action.\n- **Notable Responses:** Pieter Wuille's statement on coin confiscation was cited by Lopp as supporting evidence. Tim Ruffing's response on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list pushed back on the preemptive coin destruction aspect. Generated significant debate on governance and property rights.\n- **Source Quality:** [Developer]\n\n---\n\n### Entry 3.3\n\n- **Platform:** Web article\n- **Author/Username:** Cybernews (journalism); quoting Willy Woo, Hunter Beast, James Check\n- **Date:** February 7, 2026\n- **URL:** https://cybernews.com/crypto/bitcoin-will-become-quantum-resistant-when-it-solves-a-human-problem/\n- **Summary:** Comprehensive analysis arguing \"Bitcoin's quantum problem is more human than technical.\" Key data points: Willy Woo shared data showing 20\u201330% of Bitcoin-Dev mailing list messages in late 2025 concerned quantum resistance \u2014 a significant acceleration. James Check (Checkonchain founder) argued the \"biggest issue with preparing Bitcoin for the quantum era, should it emerge, is not technical but human: the community is notorious for year-long debates and fierce disagreements.\" Hunter Beast stated: \"Quantum is a technical problem. Migration is a human one. Unless we prepare before we need it, Bitcoin's greatest risk isn't that quantum breaks the cryptography, it's that we won't be able to move fast enough when it does.\" Also noted: Coinbase announced an \"Independent Advisory Board on Quantum Computing and Blockchain.\"\n- **Notable Responses:** Widely shared as a balanced take; represents the growing \"moderate/prepare now\" consensus forming in early 2026.\n- **Source Quality:** [Media / Industry Figure]\n\n---\n\n### Entry 3.4\n\n- **Platform:** Bitcoin Magazine article\n- **Author/Username:** Bitcoin Magazine staff; quoting Matt Corallo\n- **Date:** February 20, 2026\n- **URL:** https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoins-50-slide-quantum-scare\n- **Summary:** In this article covering Bitcoin's ~46% decline from its October 2025 all-time high (~$126,100), Matt Corallo (Bitcoin developer at Spiral/Lightning Labs) explicitly rejected quantum computing as the cause of the price drop. Speaking on the Unchained podcast with Laura Shin, Corallo argued: if investors were pricing in quantum risk to Bitcoin specifically, Ethereum would be outperforming (it was not \u2014 Ether fell 58% simultaneously). He said quantum fears may be a \"scapegoat\" for broader market dynamics. He acknowledged the need for quantum preparation but framed it as a long-term engineering task, not an emergency.\n- **Notable Responses:** Bitcoin maximalists largely agreed with Corallo's market analysis. Some noted the article does not resolve the actual quantum risk question \u2014 just the correlation with price.\n- **Source Quality:** [Developer / Media]\n\n---\n\n### Entry 3.5\n\n- **Platform:** Bitcoin.com Podcast\n- **Author/Username:** Graham Stone & David Sencil, hosts of \"The Weekly\" (Bitcoin.com News Media)\n- **Date:** December 22, 2025\n- **URL:** https://podcast.bitcoin.com/episode/68QiQL5lgKYfS7c099ovpF/\n- **Summary:** Episode titled \"Bitcoin's Quantum Problem Isn't Math \u2014 It's Governance.\" Core argument: quantum computing is back in the Bitcoin conversation \"not because it can break Bitcoin today, but because the timeline to prepare may already be shorter than many realize.\" The episode emphasizes that Bitcoin \"can't just flip a switch\" to become post-quantum secure; upgrading requires years of node operator adoption. Key topics: which addresses are most vulnerable; the controversy around Satoshi-era coins; the silent nature of quantum attacks (could happen without public warning). Covers Coinbase's push to become an \"everything exchange\" and the GENIUS Act stablecoin framework in the same episode.\n- **Notable Responses:** Representative of growing mainstream Bitcoin media discussion of the governance dimension.\n- **Source Quality:** [Media]\n\n---\n\n## Category 4: Technical Debates About Specific Solutions\n\n---\n\n### Entry 4.1\n\n- **Platform:** X/Twitter + Bitcoin GitHub\n- **Author/Username:** Hunter Beast (@cryptoquick), Protocol Engineer at Anduro; Project Lead at Surmount Systems; Lead author of BIP-360\n- **Date:** February 2026 (BIP merged); ongoing since 2024\n- **URL:** https://x.com/mr6urns/status/2027469890613817534 (BIP-360 merged announcement); BIP-360 accessible via Bitcoin GitHub\n- **Summary:** BIP-360 (\"Pay to Merkle Root\" / P2MR) was merged into the Bitcoin Core repository in February 2026, representing the first formal step toward quantum-resistant Bitcoin outputs. The BIP introduces a new output type that hides public keys in a Merkle tree root, preventing the long-range quantum attack vector (knowing the public key before transaction broadcast). Co-authored by Isabel Foxen Duke (StarkWare) and others. Hunter Beast's \"Hourglass\" companion proposal would limit P2PK spending to one input per block, spreading supply-shock risk over months rather than allowing a simultaneous quantum theft of 34,000 early-miner UTXOs. Beast has been explicit that BIP-360 alone is insufficient: full post-quantum signature migration (using NIST-standardized algorithms like ML-DSA / Dilithium or FALCON) is still needed.\n- **Notable Responses:** Received attention from Bitfinity Network, multiple Layer 2 protocols, and crypto media.

Key technical distinctions: (1) Only P2PK addresses have permanently visible public keys; (2) P2PKH, P2SH, and newer formats hide keys until a spend transaction is broadcast; (3) even in P2PK, 32,607 individual ~50 BTC UTXOs would take \"millennia to unlock even in the most outlandishly optimistic scenarios\"; (4) breaking secp256k1 within one day requires 13 million physical qubits \u2014 roughly 100,000\u00d7 Google Willow's current 105. The report opposes aggressive interventions like burning vulnerable coins, calling this \"fundamentally contradictory to Bitcoin's principles.\"\n- **Notable Responses:** Well-received by Bitcoin maximalists and institutional investors looking for reassurance.

The post directly challenged a common Bitcoin talking point about Bitcoin's governance simplicity being an advantage.\n- **Notable Responses:** Retweeted 11 times; generated debate among cross-chain researchers.

Brassard \"heckled\" Pouliot about quantum FUD during a Bitcoin speech; after a heated exchange, Brassard privately told Pouliot that \"quantum breaking Bitcoin is mostly just FUD.\" The post received 13 retweets and 288 likes. It is notable for deploying a credentialed quantum physicist's own words to support the \"non-issue\" position.\n- **Notable Responses:** Used in the \"quantum is FUD\" camp as an appeal to authority from the field's founding figure.

Community discussion highlights the core dilemma: \"It feels like choosing between two evils, hoping you picked the lesser one. Allow Satoshi-era coins to be stolen if a strong-enough quantum computer becomes a reality. That would cause a devastating effect on the network. The alternative looks even worse: freeze the coins and effectively take them out of circulation for the greater good of the network and again destroying trust in Bitcoin and censoring it.\" One respondent noted that ~5.25 million BTC with exposed public keys becoming unspendable could cause \"massive economic disruption.\" Another argued freezing is less damaging than it sounds, since it just returns coins that would otherwise be \"stolen by whoever wins the quantum race.\"\n- **Notable Responses:** Technical discussion of ZK-proof recovery (Phase C), timelock alternatives to burning, and the risk of quantum-safe schemes themselves being broken classically (historical precedent: some NIST candidates were broken during the competition).\n- **Source Quality:** [Community Member]\n\n---\n\n## Category 5: Social/Political Debates About Upgrade Governance\n\n---\n\n### Entry 5.1\n\n- **Platform:** Web article (COCA)\n- **Author/Username:** COCA App team (crypto infrastructure company)\n- **Date:** February 18, 2026\n- **URL:** https://www.coca.xyz/post/institutions-may-get-fed-up-and-fire-bitcoin-devs-over-quantum-vc\n- **Summary:** A VC-perspective piece titled \"Institutions May Get 'Fed Up' and Fire Bitcoin Devs Over Quantum.\" Core argument: if Bitcoin developers don't produce tangible quantum-readiness milestones \u2014 key-exposure dashboards, testnet pilots, migration playbooks \u2014 institutional investors will rotate leadership. Private roundtables with 70 fund managers revealed 59% ranked quantum risk in their top three operational concerns, and 38% indicated they'd tie 2026 funding to explicit cryptography roadmaps. The piece frames the governance challenge structurally: Bitcoin's open-source contributor model has no corporate accountability mechanism, but the institutions it depends on for capital do have one. \"Institutions don't fire people for researching hard problems. They fire people for ignoring them.\"\n- **Notable Responses:** Representative of growing VC/institutional pressure on Bitcoin developer community.

This represents a significant public admission from a major institutional-facing voice that quantum FUD is having a measurable effect on allocation decisions \u2014 regardless of the actual technical timeline. O'Leary's framing is risk-management-based rather than technically informed: the uncertainty itself is the problem, not the definitively imminent threat.\n- **Notable Responses:** Widely retweeted; 7 retweets, 73 likes on the original clip.

The full quantum migration would only activate later via soft fork when urgency is clear. This approach threads the needle between \"do nothing\" and \"force migration now.\" Corallo also weighed in on the governance of Satoshi's coins: if a CRQC emerges, the market will face a choice \u2014 allow quantum theft of vulnerable coins or burn/freeze them. He suggested the ZK-proof recovery (for seed-phrase holders) makes the \"burn\" path more viable.\n- **Notable Responses:** The episode was well-received as a technically credible middle position.

It cites SPHINCS+ parameter tradeoffs from Olaoluwa Osuntokun's Presidio Bitcoin Quantum Summit talk, noting customizable signatures as small as ~2KB. Advocates a market-led approach: make quantum-safe outputs available first; let large holders adopt by value; freeze debates follow adoption. **Part 2** (\"Taproot Quantum Spend Paths,\" January 2026) proposes a \"quantum Taproot\" type: disable the key-path via soft fork, create two tapleaf paths (quantum-safe + quantum-vulnerable) within a single address. Users upgrade wallets but keep using efficient classical signatures until QDay. Explicitly supports BIP-360. Includes a freeze timing table with conflicting pressures and an illustrative 9-year freeze timeline. **Part 3** (\"Mitigating The Impact Of The Quantum Freeze,\" February 2026) proposes four recovery methods for quasi-frozen coins: (1) Commitment Recovery (hash commitment + 100-block reveal of private key), (2) Seed Phrase Commitment (reveals BIP-39 words + derivation path; exploits PBKDF2/SHA-512's quantum safety), (3) Pre-QDay Commitment (useful for Satoshi's coins; a single Merkle root can cover thousands of UTXOs), (4) ZKP Seed Phrase Method (STARK-based, no advance prep needed, reusable, privacy-preserving). The series includes a comprehensive UTXO table from [Dune Analytics / murchandamus](https://dune.com/murchandamus/bitcoins-utxo-set): P2WPKH = 8,011,484 BTC (40.1%), P2PKH = 4,709,800 BTC (23.6%), P2SH = 4,045,377 BTC (20.3%), P2WSH = 1,296,835 BTC (6.5%), P2PK = 1,716,419 BTC (8.6%), Taproot = 196,292 BTC (1.0%). The table maps each output type to applicable recovery methods, concluding that \"almost every quasi frozen coin was potentially recoverable.\"\n- **Notable Responses:** The series has been cited in subsequent community discussion as the most concrete analysis of how a quantum freeze could minimize permanent coin loss. The BIP-39 quantum-safe derivation insight and STARK-based ZKP recovery proposal are original contributions.\n- **Source Quality:** [Industry Figure / Researcher]\n\n---\n\n*Last updated: 2026-02-28.

Where a question is partially addressed elsewhere in the corpus, a cross-reference is provided; where it is entirely unresolved, that fact is stated plainly.\n\nThese questions are not rhetorical. They are the load-bearing uncertainties on which billions of dollars in risk and years of protocol work depend.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Cryptographic Open Questions\n\n### 1.1 Which Post-Quantum Signature Scheme Will Bitcoin Ultimately Adopt?\n\n**Status: No consensus. Active disagreement among credentialed participants.**\n\nAs of February 2026, BIP-360's `libbitcoinpqc` library implements three NIST-standardized candidates \u2014 ML-DSA-44, SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s, and FN-DSA-512 \u2014 but no binding decision on which scheme (or schemes) Bitcoin will actually adopt has been made. The debate has crystallized around two poles:\n\n- **Hash-based (SLH-DSA / SHRINCS)**: Matt Corallo has stated \"I think right now the only thing to do would be to add hash-based signatures in Bitcoin,\" specifically endorsing Jonas Nick's SHRINCS proposal. The Chaincode Labs report recommends hash-based schemes for conservative deployments. The appeal is that hash-based security reduces entirely to SHA-256 preimage resistance \u2014 assumptions Bitcoin already depends on. See [debate-map.md](./06-people-and-orgs/debate-map.md) and [comparison-matrix.md](./04-signature-schemes/comparison-matrix.md).\n\n- **Lattice-based (ML-DSA / FN-DSA)**: BIP-360 co-author Hunter Beast and BTQ Technologies favor NIST-standardized lattice schemes because HSMs already support them and they offer substantially smaller signatures than SPHINCS+. See [crystals-dilithium.md](./04-signature-schemes/crystals-dilithium.md) and [falcon.md](./04-signature-schemes/falcon.md).\n\n**What's missing:** A formal process for selecting a scheme. Bitcoin has no equivalent of NIST's multi-year competition. The BIP process is open-ended; scheme selection will occur through social consensus that has not yet formed. The question of whether Bitcoin will adopt a single scheme or allow multiple schemes (algorithm agility) is itself unresolved.\n\n**Closely related:** Whether SHRINCS will be proposed as a formal BIP (expected at OPNEXT 2026 per [organizations.md](./06-people-and-orgs/organizations.md)), and whether the Bitcoin community will wait for FIPS 206 (FN-DSA) finalization \u2014 expected late 2026 or early 2027 \u2014 before committing. See [falcon.md](./04-signature-schemes/falcon.md).\n\n---\n\n### 1.2 Can STARK-Based Aggregation Reduce PQ Signature Sizes Enough for Practical Use?\n\n**Status: Theoretically promising. Unproven in Bitcoin context. Active research.**\n\nEthan Heilman's Non-Interactive Transaction Compression (NTC) proposal \u2014 aggregating all PQ signatures in a block into a single STARK proof \u2014 was described as potentially yielding ~87 transactions/second and reducing per-transaction PQ overhead to approximately 2 bytes per input. See [mailing-list-discussions.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/mailing-list-discussions.md) and [soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md).\n\n**What's missing:**\n- A working proof-of-concept for NTC in a Bitcoin context. As of February 2026, no implementation exists.\n- Verification that STARK proof generation time is compatible with Bitcoin's 10-minute block interval and the bandwidth constraints of full nodes.\n- Whether NTC requires new transaction types and what their consensus impact would be \u2014 particularly whether this constitutes a hard fork or can be structured as a soft fork.\n- Whether STARK proof sizes (~100\u2013200 KB for current circuit sizes) are manageable within Bitcoin's block weight limits without dramatically increasing block size.\n- Security analysis: STARKs are relatively new in production contexts; their applicability to signature aggregation over heterogeneous PQ schemes (mixing ML-DSA, FN-DSA, and SLH-DSA signatures in one proof) is uncharted.\n\nThis is one of the most promising \u2014 and most speculative \u2014 approaches in the entire corpus. If it works, it could solve Bitcoin's block-size problem with PQ signatures without a witness discount increase or block size increase. If it doesn't, it's back to the uncomfortable tradeoff documented in [integration-challenges.md](./05-code-and-implementations/integration-challenges.md).\n\n---\n\n### 1.3 Will FALCON's Gaussian Sampling Side-Channel Issues Be Resolved?\n\n**Status: Partially mitigated. Formally unresolved for consensus-critical deployment.**\n\nFALCON (FN-DSA) offers the most compact lattice signatures (~666 bytes for FN-DSA-512), but its Gaussian sampling mechanism requires floating-point arithmetic, creating 6\u20138\u00d7 performance variation depending on hardware FPU availability and documented side-channel risks. See [falcon.md](./04-signature-schemes/falcon.md) in detail.\n\n**What's missing:**\n- A verified constant-time implementation of FALCON's Gaussian sampler suitable for consensus-critical code (where timing side channels could enable private key extraction).\n- Resolution of the variable signature size issue: FALCON signatures range from roughly 617 to 809 bytes depending on sampling outcome. Bitcoin's scripting system benefits from predictable transaction sizes; this variability complicates fee estimation and witness discount design.\n- FIPS 206 finalization \u2014 the draft standard submitted August 28, 2025 \"may include adjustments to the way signing and sampling work,\" per DigiCert's analysis. No implementation should be finalized before FIPS 206 is published (expected late 2026 or early 2027). See [falcon.md](./04-signature-schemes/falcon.md).\n- Whether a softcoded implementation (without hardware FPU) is fast enough for Bitcoin full-node verification under realistic transaction loads.\n\nThe NIST process delayed FALCON precisely because of these concerns. Bitcoin developers will need to see FIPS 206 and independent security audits of constant-time implementations before FALCON becomes a viable candidate.\n\n---\n\n### 1.4 Are Lattice-Based Assumptions (LWE/SIS) as Robust as Hash-Based Assumptions Long-Term?\n\n**Status: Open fundamental question. No evidence of vulnerability, but not proven equivalent.**\n\nThe entire lattice-based PQ family \u2014 ML-DSA (Module-LWE/SIS) and FN-DSA (NTRU/SIS) \u2014 rests on hardness assumptions that, while well-studied since ~2009, are far younger than SHA-256's security tradition (2001, with SHA-256's predecessor SHA-1 dating to 1995). See [crystals-dilithium.md](./04-signature-schemes/crystals-dilithium.md) and [comparison-matrix.md](./04-signature-schemes/comparison-matrix.md).\n\n**What's missing:**\n- Independent cryptanalytic validation of ML-DSA and FN-DSA assumptions over a longer timeframe. The NIST PQC process provided a meaningful stress test, but most of the 6-year analysis period focused on identifying specific attacks; absence of attack is not a proof of hardness.\n- Understanding whether a single mathematical breakthrough could simultaneously undermine Module-LWE (ML-DSA), NTRU (FN-DSA), and related problems. The 2022 SIKE break (a different lattice-adjacent scheme \u2014 isogeny-based \u2014 broken in 62 minutes on a laptop) is a cautionary data point, even though SIKE used different mathematics. See [other-candidates.md](./04-signature-schemes/other-candidates.md).\n- Quantum cryptanalysis of lattice problems beyond the known quadratic Grover speedup. No quantum algorithm is currently known that provides more than quadratic speedup on LWE, but this has not been formally proved.\n\nThis is the fundamental reason Matt Corallo and Jonas Nick favor hash-based schemes as Bitcoin's first PQ commitment: hash function security is the most battle-tested assumption in cryptography. See [debate-map.md](./06-people-and-orgs/debate-map.md).\n\n---\n\n### 1.5 Could a Breakthrough in Quantum Algorithms Change the Threat Timeline?\n\n**Status: Unknowable by definition. Significant research underway.**\n\nAll timeline estimates in this corpus rest on one key anchor: **2,330 logical qubits** required to break ECDSA-256, per R\u00f6tteler et al. (2017). But this is a lower bound under current algorithm knowledge, not a physical constant. See [shor-vs-ecdsa.md](./01-threat-model/shor-vs-ecdsa.md) and [quantum-progress-timeline.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/quantum-progress-timeline.md).\n\n**What's missing:**\n- Whether algorithmic improvements could reduce qubit requirements below the current ~2,330 logical qubit estimate. A 2025 preprint cited in [shor-vs-ecdsa.md](./01-threat-model/shor-vs-ecdsa.md) suggests estimates in the 100,000\u20132,871 logical qubit range depending on depth-vs-space trade-offs. The 2025 Gidney update reduced RSA-2048 physical qubit estimates 20-fold from 2019 estimates \u2014 demonstrating that algorithmic improvements can dramatically change the picture. See [quantum-progress-timeline.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/quantum-progress-timeline.md).\n- Whether a quantum algorithm other than Shor's could attack ECDLP with even greater efficiency. The known quantum algorithms for discrete logarithm problems are all variants of Shor's period-finding approach; no fundamentally different approach is known. But this field is ~30 years old.\n- Whether post-quantum schemes themselves could be vulnerable to not-yet-discovered quantum algorithms. No quantum speedup is known for LWE or SIS, but \"not known\" is not the same as \"impossible.\"\n\n**Practical implication:** The \"comfortable\" timeline estimates in [gap-analysis.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/gap-analysis.md) \u2014 which place T_quantum in the 2031\u20132035 range for the central scenario \u2014 implicitly assume no major algorithmic breakthroughs. A single well-publicized breakthrough could compress this timeline dramatically and without warning.\n\n---\n\n### 1.6 SQIsign: Will It Mature Enough for Bitcoin Consideration?\n\n**Status: In NIST Round 2. Currently excluded from BIP-360. Path to Bitcoin adoption long.**\n\nSQIsign (Short Quaternion and Isogeny Signature) offers the most compact PQ signatures of any scheme: 65-byte public key + 148-byte signature at NIST Level I \u2014 a combined 213 bytes, only 2.2\u00d7 ECDSA. This would be a near-perfect fit for Bitcoin's block size constraints. See [other-candidates.md](./04-signature-schemes/other-candidates.md) and [comparison-matrix.md](./04-signature-schemes/comparison-matrix.md).\n\n**What's missing:**\n- Speed improvements sufficient for Bitcoin full-node verification. Current SQIsign verification is ~5.1 million CPU cycles (~1.7 ms on a 3 GHz CPU) \u2014 approximately 8\u00d7 slower than ML-DSA and roughly 25\u201350\u00d7 slower than ECDSA. A full block of SQIsign transactions would require hours to verify, not seconds. Earlier versions were 15,000\u00d7 slower than ECDSA; recent \"SQIsign2D\" improvements are significant but not sufficient.\n- Full NIST standardization. SQIsign is in Round 2 of the Additional Signatures evaluation; standardization, if it occurs, is years away.\n- Rebuilding cryptographic confidence after the 2022 SIKE break. SIKE used a different isogeny framework (SIDH), but the break \u2014 a 62-minute classical laptop attack on a scheme that had survived multiple analysis rounds \u2014 damaged confidence in isogeny-based cryptography broadly. SQIsign uses endomorphism rings, not SIDH, but the caution is warranted.\n\n**Why this matters for the corpus:** If SQIsign's verification speed improves by another 10\u201320\u00d7 through algorithmic or hardware advances, it becomes a compelling candidate that could make the block size problem nearly disappear. This is a genuine \"watch this space\" item for 2026\u20132027 research.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Protocol and Governance Open Questions\n\n### 2.1 How Will the Bitcoin Community Decide on a Signature Scheme?\n\n**Status: Process undefined. No precedent for a decision of this type.**\n\nBitcoin's governance model \u2014 rough consensus among developers, miners, and economic nodes \u2014 has successfully handled upgrades like SegWit and Taproot, but those upgrades offered clear benefits. The PQ upgrade is a purely defensive measure imposing immediate costs (larger transactions, higher fees, reduced throughput) against a probabilistic future threat. See [bitcoin-migration-timeline.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/bitcoin-migration-timeline.md) and [soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md).\n\n**What's missing:**\n- A defined process for reaching consensus on scheme selection. The BIP process is a specification format, not a decision-making protocol. There is no equivalent of NIST's multi-year competition or a formal voting mechanism.\n- Whether the Bitcoin community will adopt a single scheme (concentrating cryptographic risk but simplifying implementation) or multiple schemes in parallel (algorithmic agility, but increasing code complexity and block-size overhead). BIP-360 currently includes three schemes; no decision has been made on which to activate first.\n- How to handle disagreement between Bitcoin Core developers (who lean toward hash-based conservative approaches) and application developers and custodians (who prefer NIST-standardized lattice schemes with existing HSM support). See [debate-map.md](./06-people-and-orgs/debate-map.md).\n- Whether an external catalyst (a quantum computing announcement, a demonstrated theft of dormant P2PK coins, or a nation-state disclosure) would shift the governance dynamic enough to overcome inertia.\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 What Happens to Satoshi's ~1.1 Million BTC in P2PK Addresses?\n\n**Status: The single most politically explosive unresolved question in this corpus.**\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto's estimated 1.1 million BTC is held predominantly in P2PK addresses created in 2009\u20132010, making it the largest single quantum-vulnerable position on any blockchain. These coins have never moved in 15+ years and are widely presumed to represent lost keys. See [vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md](./01-threat-model/vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md) for the full technical analysis.\n\n**What's missing:**\n- Any community consensus on what to do with these coins. The options range from:\n  - **Do nothing** \u2014 accept that a CRQC operator could steal them\n  - **Freeze** \u2014 via soft fork, make P2PK outputs unspendable after a deadline (effectively destroying the coins if keys are lost, or confiscating them if a quantum thief acts first)\n  - **Burn** \u2014 destroy them provably via a hard fork or coordinated protocol change\n  - **Proof-of-ownership challenge** \u2014 require holders to prove ownership of associated metadata within a timeframe before keys are quantum-exposed\n\n- Whether freezing Satoshi's coins constitutes confiscation \u2014 a deeply contested issue touching Bitcoin's core value proposition of immutable property rights. See [debate-map.md](./06-people-and-orgs/debate-map.md) and [soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md) for the range of positions (Lopp and Wuille support freezing; Todd and Bendiksen oppose any confiscation).\n- What the market impact would be: [vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md](./01-threat-model/vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md) cites analysis that moving Satoshi's coins via quantum theft \"would serve as proof of a successful attack, triggering market-wide panic, a bank run on exchanges, and an existential crisis for the entire crypto ecosystem.\"\n- Whether the \"Hourglass\" proposal \u2014 rate-limiting P2PK spending to one input per block, spreading quantum-theft risk over ~8 months \u2014 is a viable alternative to freezing. See [conference-talks.md](./08-community-sentiment/conference-talks.md) and [bip-catalog.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/bip-catalog.md).\n\nThis question has no good answers \u2014 only tradeoffs between property rights and systemic risk.\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 Will the \"Do Nothing\" Camp Block Soft Fork Activation?\n\n**Status: Open governance risk. Historical precedent is mixed.**\n\nBIP-360 was merged into the Bitcoin BIP repository on February 11, 2026, but BIPs repository inclusion is not activation \u2014 it \"doesn't imply consensus, adoption, or that the idea is even good,\" per the repository's own disclaimer. See [bitcoin-migration-timeline.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/bitcoin-migration-timeline.md).\n\n**What's missing:**\n- Whether prominent Bitcoin Core contributors who currently see \"no urgency\" (Pieter Wuille, February 2025) or believe the threat is \"20\u201340 years away\" (Adam Back) will actively oppose or passively neglect the activation process. See [debate-map.md](./06-people-and-orgs/debate-map.md) and [notable-threads-and-posts.md](./08-community-sentiment/notable-threads-and-posts.md).\n- What activation mechanism BIP-360 will use. Miner signaling (as used for SegWit and Taproot) requires miner coordination. A \"flag day\" activation avoids miner veto but is more technically risky. Neither has been specified.\n- Whether exchange operators, institutional custodians, and ETF managers \u2014 who collectively control substantial economic weight \u2014 will apply pressure for activation. This pressure was absent during Taproot's activation period; whether it materializes for PQ is unknown.\n- The \"do nothing and wait for a crisis\" scenario: the JBBA paper's analysis suggests this is the \"most likely outcome\" under current governance dynamics. See [bitcoin-migration-timeline.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/bitcoin-migration-timeline.md).\n\n---\n\n### 2.4 Can a Soft Fork Handle the Block Size Requirements of PQ Signatures?\n\n**Status: Technically contested. The central engineering constraint.**\n\nWithout mitigation, Bitcoin's 4 MB weight limit would collapse transaction throughput from ~2,500\u20133,000 P2WPKH transactions per block to ~90\u2013130 with ML-DSA or ~30\u201350 with SPHINCS+. The proposed solution \u2014 a \"QuBit witness discount\" of 4\u201364\u00d7 \u2014 would increase chain state growth from ~100 GB/year to potentially 200\u2013500 GB/year. See [integration-challenges.md](./05-code-and-implementations/integration-challenges.md) and [soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md).\n\n**What's missing:**\n- Community consensus on an acceptable witness discount level. A 16\u00d7 discount was already described as \"far too much for the community to accept\" by BIP-360's own author; a 4\u00d7 discount leaves throughput severely degraded. See [mailing-list-discussions.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/mailing-list-discussions.md).\n- Whether NTC (STARK-based signature compression) can be developed and deployed on the same timeline as BIP-360, potentially eliminating the block size problem. See section 1.2 above and [soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md).\n- What the node operator community's tolerance is for increased storage and bandwidth requirements. BTQ's testnet uses 64 MiB blocks \u2014 16\u00d7 Bitcoin's current limit \u2014 as the only currently proven approach. See [proof-of-concepts.md](./05-code-and-implementations/proof-of-concepts.md). This is politically untenable on Bitcoin mainnet but illustrates the engineering reality.\n- Whether BIP-32 HD wallet compatibility issues for ML-DSA (identified on the developer mailing list) can be resolved without breaking wallet ecosystem compatibility. See [crystals-dilithium.md](./04-signature-schemes/crystals-dilithium.md) and [integration-challenges.md](./05-code-and-implementations/integration-challenges.md).\n\n---\n\n### 2.5 Will OP_CAT Be Activated, Enabling Hash-Based PQ Signatures as an Interim Solution?\n\n**Status: OP_CAT (BIP-347) is a live proposal. Activation status unknown.**\n\nReactivating the disabled OP_CAT opcode enables Lamport or Winternitz one-time signatures entirely within existing tapscript \u2014 without any new PQ-specific opcodes. Conduition demonstrated that OP_CAT-based Winternitz signatures cost ~2,000 vbytes per input. See [soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md) and [active-repos.md](./05-code-and-implementations/active-repos.md).\n\n**What's missing:**\n- Whether OP_CAT will be activated at all. BIP-347 has multiple use cases beyond quantum resistance (including covenants and other script functionality), and has substantial support among developers; however, activation requires the same rough-consensus process as any other soft fork.\n- Whether OP_CAT-based PQ signatures are sufficient as a standalone quantum defense, or whether they only work in conjunction with BIP-360's removal of the Taproot keypath spend. The BIP-347 specification explicitly states: \"The use of Lamport Signatures in taproot outputs is unlikely to be quantum resistant... because taproot outputs can also be spent with a key.\" BIP-360 is technically a prerequisite for OP_CAT-based PQ signatures to provide complete protection. See [soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md).\n- Whether OP_CAT-based signatures (at ~2,000 vbytes per input) are economically viable as a long-term solution given fee pressures, or whether they are only appropriate as an emergency interim measure.\n\n---\n\n### 2.6 What Is the Realistic Timeline for BIP-360 to Reach Activation?\n\n**Status: Unknown. Wide range of estimates. No activation mechanism specified.**\n\nBIP-360 was merged into the Bitcoin BIPs repository on February 11, 2026, marking a significant milestone \u2014 but it remains a Draft proposal with no Bitcoin Core implementation PR and no activation mechanism. See [bip-catalog.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/bip-catalog.md) and [bitcoin-migration-timeline.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/bitcoin-migration-timeline.md).\n\n**What's missing:**\n- A Bitcoin Core implementation pull request. No PR exists as of February 2026. Writing, reviewing, and merging the implementation typically takes 1\u20133 years for a soft fork of this complexity.\n- A specified activation mechanism. The BIP draft does not yet specify whether it will use BIP-9-style miner signaling, a Speedy Trial, or a flag day. Each has different political implications.\n- Resolution of known open issues in the BIP specification, including BIP-32 xpub compatibility for watch-only wallets and m-of-n multisig specification. See [active-repos.md](./05-code-and-implementations/active-repos.md).\n- Whether Phase 2 (adding PQ signature opcodes) can be developed and activated close enough to Phase 1 (P2MR output type) to provide meaningful short-exposure protection before a CRQC exists.\n\nEthan Heilman's estimate of 7 years from the point consensus is reached \u2014 broken down as 2.5 years code review/testing, 6 months activation, 4+ years ecosystem migration \u2014 sets the outer bound. If consensus is reached in 2026\u20132027, that implies full migration completing no earlier than 2033\u20132034, which the gap analysis identifies as the central CRQC scenario. See [gap-analysis.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/gap-analysis.md).\n\n---\n\n### 2.7 Will BIP-110 Block the Post-Quantum Migration Path?\n\n**Status: Open. BIP-110 activation targeting August\u2013September 2026. PQ implications not yet publicly debated.**\n\nBIP-110 (Reduced Data Temporary Softfork, Luke Dashjr et al.) proposes capping witness elements at 256 bytes to restrict inscriptions, with activation targeting block heights 961,632\u2013965,664 (approximately August\u2013September 2026). As of February 2026, approximately 5% of nodes enforce BIP-110 rules per [BIP-110 tracking](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/services.html). See [bip-catalog.md](../03-proposals-and-bips/bip-catalog.md).\n\nThe tension: every NIST-standardized post-quantum signature exceeds 256 bytes (SHRINCS ~324B, FN-DSA ~666B, ML-DSA 2,420B, SLH-DSA 7,856B). If BIP-110 activates, post-quantum signatures would be invalid under its rules. Some developers (unattributed, as of February 2026) have proposed a three-step activation sequence \u2014 BIP-54 (consensus cleanup) \u2192 defeat BIP-110 \u2192 BIP-360 activation client \u2014 explicitly framing PQ readiness as an argument against BIP-110. See [mailing-list-discussions.md](../03-proposals-and-bips/mailing-list-discussions.md).\n\n**What's missing:**\n- No public analysis of whether BIP-110's restrictions could coexist with a future PQ soft fork (e.g., by exempting PQ witness types).\n- No clear expiration mechanism for BIP-110's \"temporary\" restrictions.\n- No public debate or mailing list thread explicitly connecting BIP-110 to PQ readiness as of late February 2026.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Timeline Uncertainties\n\n### 3.1 When Will Error-Corrected Quantum Computers Reach 2,330+ Logical Qubits?\n\n**Status: Best estimate 2031\u20132035. Wide uncertainty. Subject to algorithmic revision.**\n\nThe canonical 2,330 logical qubit threshold (R\u00f6tteler et al. 2017) for breaking ECDSA-256 is the central number in every timeline estimate in this corpus. As of February 2026, the best publicly demonstrated logical qubit count is 48 (Quantinuum Helios, November 2025) \u2014 approximately 50\u00d7 short of the threshold. See [quantum-hardware-status.md](./01-threat-model/quantum-hardware-status.md), [quantum-progress-timeline.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/quantum-progress-timeline.md), and [gap-analysis.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/gap-analysis.md).\n\n**What's missing:**\n- Whether IBM Blue Jay (2033 target, ~2,000 logical qubits) will actually achieve its specifications on schedule. IBM's roadmap is the industry's most detailed public forecast but has historically shifted. 2,000 logical qubits is just below the 2,330 threshold \u2014 whether it crosses this threshold depends on algorithmic optimizations in Shor's circuit implementation that remain an active research area.\n- IonQ's trajectory: their roadmap targets 8,000 logical qubits by 2029, which would well exceed the threshold. Whether this is achievable \u2014 trapped-ion systems have better gate fidelity than superconducting but slower gate speeds \u2014 is contested. See [quantum-hardware-status.md](./01-threat-model/quantum-hardware-status.md).\n- Microsoft's Majorana 1 topological qubit architecture: if the claimed path to 1 million qubits on a palm-sized chip materializes, it could radically compress all timelines. The February 2025 announcement was extraordinary but has not been independently replicated. See [quantum-progress-timeline.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/quantum-progress-timeline.md).\n- Whether algorithmic improvements reduce the logical qubit count below 2,330. A 2025 preprint cited in [shor-vs-ecdsa.md](./01-threat-model/shor-vs-ecdsa.md) references estimates as low as 2,871 logical qubits under QLDPC codes \u2014 barely above current estimates \u2014 but the most aggressive reduction claims remain unreviewed.\n\n**Prediction market context:** Kalshi implied a 39% probability of a \"useful quantum computer\" by 2030, and the Metaculus median estimate for RSA factoring was ~2034 as of early 2026. ECDSA-256 (Bitcoin's scheme) is easier to break than RSA, so T_quantum for Bitcoin likely precedes these RSA estimates. See [gap-analysis.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/gap-analysis.md).\n\n---\n\n### 3.2 Is \"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later\" Already Happening with P2PK Public Keys?\n\n**Status: Cannot be confirmed or denied. High-value target. Rational to assume yes.**\n\nP2PK outputs \u2014 containing ~1.72 million BTC including Satoshi's coins \u2014 have permanently exposed public keys visible to anyone with blockchain access. A sophisticated adversary can harvest these public keys today and decrypt them when (if) a CRQC becomes available. See [vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md](./01-threat-model/vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md) and [shor-vs-ecdsa.md](./01-threat-model/shor-vs-ecdsa.md).\n\n**What's missing:**\n- Any public evidence of active \"harvest now, decrypt later\" operations targeting Bitcoin P2PK addresses. All public blockchain data is inherently accessible; no special effort is required to harvest it. Any sophisticated nation-state or well-resourced actor would already have a complete database of all P2PK public keys (there are only ~38,157 P2PK addresses per the Checkonchain analysis cited in [vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md](./01-threat-model/vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md)).\n- Whether any non-public quantum computing capabilities exist that are ahead of published roadmaps. This is a classified intelligence question that the corpus cannot address. The concern is noted by multiple sources: BIP-360 co-author Hunter Beast cited the NSA's CNSA 2.0 timeline (sunset EC/RSA in new systems by 2030) as evidence \"they must know something.\" See [conference-talks.md](./08-community-sentiment/conference-talks.md).\n- Whether even the long-exposure attack against P2PK addresses is currently feasible in the absence of a CRQC, or whether it only becomes relevant once quantum hardware reaches the threshold. The answer is that current hardware is ~50\u00d7 short of even 2,330 logical qubits, so harvest-and-wait is the current state \u2014 not active decryption.\n\n---\n\n### 3.3 Could Classified Quantum Capabilities Be Ahead of Public Knowledge?\n\n**Status: Unknown by definition. Reasonable precautionary concern.**\n\nThe NSA's CNSA 2.0 directive (issued 2022, with 2030/2035 deadlines for retiring EC/RSA) and NIST's IR 8547 timeline suggest institutional awareness of a closer-than-public threat horizon. The intelligence community rarely explains the full basis for its cryptographic deprecation timelines. See [conference-talks.md](./08-community-sentiment/conference-talks.md) and [quantum-hardware-status.md](./01-threat-model/quantum-hardware-status.md).\n\n**What's missing:**\n- Any public information about classified quantum computing programs at NSA, GCHQ, or other signals intelligence agencies. By definition, this cannot be in the corpus.\n- An assessment of whether the gap between classified and public capabilities is likely to be measured in months, years, or decades. Historical precedent from classical computing suggests classified capabilities sometimes lead public knowledge by 5\u201310 years for specific narrow applications.\n- Whether nation-state adversaries (China, Russia) have quantum capabilities that exceed publicly announced roadmaps. China's quantum computing investment is substantial; Baidu's quantum roadmap and USTC's photonic quantum computing milestones are publicly documented, but represent only what is disclosed. See [quantum-hardware-status.md](./01-threat-model/quantum-hardware-status.md).\n\n**Practical implication:** The precautionary principle applied to this uncertainty favors beginning Bitcoin's migration earlier rather than later. As Ethan Heilman has noted, the 7-year migration timeline means starting in 2026 still puts full protection potentially past 2033 \u2014 the near edge of the central CRQC scenario. See [gap-analysis.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/gap-analysis.md).\n\n---\n\n### 3.4 How Quickly Could Bitcoin Mobilize in an Emergency Scenario?\n\n**Status: Poorly understood. No emergency protocol exists.**\n\nIf a CRQC were demonstrated or credibly announced, what would Bitcoin's response timeline look like? No emergency coordination mechanism exists. See [bitcoin-migration-timeline.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/bitcoin-migration-timeline.md) and [soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md).\n\n**What's missing:**\n- A formal emergency response playbook for Bitcoin. There is none. The \"transitory soft fork\" proposed by Tadge Dryja \u2014 a temporary restriction on quantum-insecure ECDSA/Schnorr signatures triggered by a demonstrated on-chain proof of quantum capability \u2014 is the closest thing to an emergency mechanism in any current proposal. See [mailing-list-discussions.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/mailing-list-discussions.md).\n- Whether even an emergency soft fork (restricting quantum-insecure spending) could be activated fast enough to matter. The activation process for SegWit and Taproot each took 17\u201320 months from BIP finalization to locked-in activation. An emergency could compress this to weeks via flag-day activation, but flag-day activations carry chain-split risk.\n- The Pont et al. (2024) paper cited in [key-findings-synthesis.md](./02-academic-research/key-findings-synthesis.md) calculates a minimum 76-day downtime requirement for a complete technical migration. Even under emergency conditions, the UTXO set cannot be migrated instantaneously.\n- Whether the Delphi Digital \"quantum canary\" model \u2014 using BTQ's Bitcoin Quantum testnet as a battle-testing ground for emergency procedures \u2014 could provide a validated playbook. As of February 2026, the testnet is live but has no connection to any Bitcoin mainnet emergency protocol. See [proof-of-concepts.md](./05-code-and-implementations/proof-of-concepts.md).\n\nThe honest answer: Bitcoin currently has no credible emergency quantum response capability. Everything in the current BIP-360 trajectory is a years-long gradual process, not an emergency mechanism.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Research Gaps in This Corpus\n\n### 4.1 What Areas Does This Corpus Not Adequately Cover?\n\n**The corpus covers the threat model, academic literature, protocol proposals, signature schemes, implementations, key people, and timelines comprehensively as of February 2026. The following areas are underrepresented:**\n\n**Lightning Network quantum exposure**: The corpus has no dedicated file on how the Lightning Network \u2014 with its HTLC contracts, multi-hop routing, and partially revealed scripts in channels \u2014 creates quantum attack surfaces beyond the base layer. Lightning channels that are open for extended periods expose public keys in ways that differ from UTXO-based attacks. A CRQC could potentially force-close all Lightning channels and steal in-flight payments. This deserves a dedicated analysis.\n\n**Layer 2 and DeFi exposure**: Federated sidechains (Liquid, RSK), Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), and other Layer 2 constructions each have their own quantum exposure profiles. The corpus mentions federated L2 treasuries in the context of HSM support for ML-DSA (see [crystals-dilithium.md](./04-signature-schemes/crystals-dilithium.md)) but does not systematically analyze L2 quantum risks.\n\n**Hardware wallet migration**: No file addresses how Ledger, Trezor, Coldcard, and other hardware wallet manufacturers would handle a PQ signature upgrade. The migration requires users to re-derive keys under new PQ algorithms and potentially re-create seed phrases. This is the last mile of ecosystem adoption and is entirely absent from the corpus.\n\n**International dimension**: China, Russia, the EU, and other jurisdictions each have active PQ standardization programs and quantum computing investments. Whether foreign quantum capabilities or regulatory mandates (e.g., EU quantum-readiness requirements for financial infrastructure) could create external pressure on Bitcoin's timeline is not covered.\n\n**Economic modeling**: No file provides quantitative estimates of the economic impact of different migration scenarios \u2014 what happens to Bitcoin's price, fee market, miner revenue, and exchange volumes during a PQ transition. The qualitative analysis is thorough, but no formal economic model exists.\n\n**Taproot-specific risks**: BIP-341 (Taproot) exposes a tweaked internal public key in every P2TR scriptPubKey. As of early 2026, approximately ~146,715\u2013184,000 BTC reside in Taproot outputs (per [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) and [Checkonchain (December 2025)](https://newsletter.checkonchain.com/p/one-day-satoshis-coins-will-move)), making this the fastest-growing quantum-vulnerable address pool. The corpus covers this in [bip-catalog.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/bip-catalog.md) and [vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md](./01-threat-model/vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md) but lacks a dedicated analysis of the Taproot-specific threat.\n\n---\n\n### 4.2 What New Developments Should Be Watched for?\n\n**Quantum hardware milestones to monitor:**\n- IBM Starling (expected 2029): IBM's first large-scale fault-tolerant system, targeting ~200 logical qubits. Not sufficient to break ECDSA-256 alone, but represents the first system where the trajectory to the Bitcoin threat threshold becomes clearly quantifiable.\n- IBM Blue Jay (expected 2033): Targeting ~2,000 logical qubits. The first system that may approach or reach the CRQC threshold for Bitcoin. See [quantum-hardware-status.md](./01-threat-model/quantum-hardware-status.md) and [quantum-progress-timeline.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/quantum-progress-timeline.md).\n- IonQ Forte Pro and subsequent trapped-ion milestones (2026\u20132029): IonQ's trapped-ion roadmap targets 8,000+ logical qubits by 2029. Independent verification of IonQ's progress is the single most important hardware signal to watch. See [quantum-hardware-status.md](./01-threat-model/quantum-hardware-status.md).\n- Microsoft Majorana 1 independent replication: Microsoft's February 2025 topological qubit announcement, if replicated and confirmed, would represent a paradigm shift in physical-to-logical qubit ratios and could dramatically compress all timelines. See [quantum-progress-timeline.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/quantum-progress-timeline.md).\n- Google Willow successor: Google's December 2024 \"below threshold\" error correction milestone established a foundation; the next Google chip should demonstrate this scaling to hundreds of physical qubits. See [quantum-hardware-status.md](./01-threat-model/quantum-hardware-status.md).\n\n**Protocol developments to monitor:**\n- OPNEXT 2026 (April 16, 2026): Jonas Nick is scheduled to present OP_SHRINCSVERIFY. The reception of this presentation by Bitcoin developers will be an important signal about whether the developer community is coalescing around hash-based signatures. See [organizations.md](./06-people-and-orgs/organizations.md).\n- FIPS 206 finalization (expected late 2026 / early 2027): FN-DSA (FALCON) finalization will remove the \"wait for the standard\" blocker on FALCON-based proposals. See [falcon.md](./04-signature-schemes/falcon.md).\n- OP_CAT (BIP-347) activation status: If OP_CAT activates in 2026, it immediately enables an interim PQ protection path via Winternitz/Lamport signatures. See [soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md).\n- Bitcoin Core BIP-360 implementation PR: The filing of a formal implementation PR for BIP-360 in Bitcoin Core would mark the transition from proposal to implementation phase.\n- NTC (STARK-based compression) proof-of-concept: Ethan Heilman's Non-Interactive Transaction Compression proposal needs a working implementation to evaluate feasibility. See [mailing-list-discussions.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/mailing-list-discussions.md).\n\n**Cryptographic research to monitor:**\n- SQIsign Round 2 evaluation results: NIST's additional signatures process should yield deeper cryptanalysis of SQIsign's security assumptions and updated speed benchmarks. If verification speed improves substantially, SQIsign's Bitcoin candidacy reopens. See [other-candidates.md](./04-signature-schemes/other-candidates.md).\n- NIST \"Smaller SLH-DSA\" parameter sets: NIST is developing new SLH-DSA parameter sets with a 2^24 signature limit (reduced from 2^64) that achieve smaller signatures. If these achieve substantially smaller sizes, SPHINCS+ becomes more competitive with FALCON for Bitcoin use. See [sphincs-plus.md](./04-signature-schemes/sphincs-plus.md).\n- New quantum algorithms for ECDLP: Any preprint claiming a quantum speedup beyond Shor's on elliptic curve discrete logarithm should be treated as a high-priority signal, regardless of whether it is immediately practical.\n\n---\n\n### 4.3 Which Papers or Proposals Are Expected in 2026\u20132027?\n\nBased on work in progress as of February 2026:\n\n**Expected proposals and BIPs:**\n- **OP_SHRINCSVERIFY BIP** (Blockstream/Jonas Nick): A formal BIP for a tapscript opcode verifying SHRINCS signatures. OPNEXT presentation scheduled April 2026. See [organizations.md](./06-people-and-orgs/organizations.md) and [comparison-matrix.md](./04-signature-schemes/comparison-matrix.md).\n- **BIP-360 Phase 2 BIPs** (Hunter Beast et al.): Follow-on BIPs specifying PQ signature opcodes for tapscript, to be built on BIP-360's P2MR foundation. These are described as \"follow-on BIPs\" in [bip-catalog.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/bip-catalog.md) but are not yet written.\n- **BIP for NTC / STARK compression** (Ethan Heilman): If the proof-of-concept advances, a formal proposal for Non-Interactive Transaction Compression is expected. See [mailing-list-discussions.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/mailing-list-discussions.md).\n- **Updated Chaincode Labs report**: The May 2025 Chaincode report was described as preliminary. An updated analysis incorporating BIP-360's merger and 2026 hardware developments is anticipated.\n\n**Expected academic work:**\n- **Project Eleven ECDLP benchmark results**: Project Eleven launched a competition in April 2025 (the Q-Day Prize) with a $1M reward for quantum-breaking any secp256k1 key on a quantum computer. Results, even null results, will be informative about the practical state of quantum hardware. See [key-researchers.md](./06-people-and-orgs/key-researchers.md).\n- **Dallaire-Demers et al. follow-up work** on the secp256k1 ECDLP challenge ladder (arXiv:2508.14011): This August 2025 paper established benchmark instances; follow-up work testing these on actual quantum hardware is expected. See [shor-vs-ecdsa.md](./01-threat-model/shor-vs-ecdsa.md).\n- **BIP-32 compatibility solutions for ML-DSA**: Multiple research groups (including the Seck & Roux-Langlois team) are working on HD wallet compatibility for lattice-based schemes. Solutions are expected in the 2026\u20132027 timeframe. See [crystals-dilithium.md](./04-signature-schemes/crystals-dilithium.md).\n- **SQIsign2D-West performance benchmarks on commodity hardware**: The latest SQIsign optimizations have not been systematically benchmarked on the hardware that Bitcoin full nodes actually use. Independent benchmarks are needed to assess whether SQIsign is approaching practical viability. See [other-candidates.md](./04-signature-schemes/other-candidates.md).\n\n---\n\n## Summary: The Most Critical Unresolved Questions\n\nIf forced to identify the five questions whose answers would most change the analysis in this corpus, they are:\n\n1. **Will IBM Blue Jay (2033) actually achieve 2,000+ logical qubits, and will algorithmic improvements bring the CRQC threshold below that?** The answer determines whether the expected T_quantum is in the early 2030s or mid-2030s \u2014 a difference that may or may not precede T_migration. See [gap-analysis.md](./07-timeline-and-risk/gap-analysis.md).\n\n2. **Will the Bitcoin developer community coalesce around a single PQ signature scheme \u2014 specifically SHRINCS vs. NIST-standardized lattice schemes \u2014 and if so, when?** The signature scheme decision gates all subsequent BIP development and ecosystem migration. See [debate-map.md](./06-people-and-orgs/debate-map.md).\n\n3. **Can STARK-based signature compression (NTC) be made to work in Bitcoin's context?** If yes, the block-size problem largely disappears. If no, Bitcoin faces a fundamental tension between quantum security and transaction throughput that may require a hard fork. See [soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md](./03-proposals-and-bips/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork.md).\n\n4. **What will the Bitcoin community decide about Satoshi's coins?** This question touches the deepest values of the Bitcoin community \u2014 property rights, immutability, and systemic risk \u2014 and there is no answer that satisfies all stakeholders. The decision (including the decision to make no decision) will define Bitcoin's character in the quantum era. See [vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md](./01-threat-model/vulnerable-vs-safe-utxos.md).\n\n5. **Are classified quantum capabilities already ahead of public roadmaps?** This question cannot be answered within an open corpus. But it is the one most likely to make all other timeline analysis irrelevant if its answer is \"yes, significantly.\" See [quantum-hardware-status.md](./01-threat-model/quantum-hardware-status.md).\n\n---\n\n*End of open questions file. This document should be treated as a living record \u2014 each question above should be revisited as hardware milestones are achieved, BIPs progress, and the research landscape evolves.*\n",
  "10-synthesis/EXECUTIVE-BRIEF": "# Executive Brief: The Quantum Threat to Bitcoin\n\n\n> **Last updated:** February 28, 2026 | **Confidence shelf-life:** 6 months (depends on synthesis)\n\n\n*February 28, 2026 \u2014 Entry point for the Bitcoin Quantum Threat Research Corpus*\n\n---\n\n## The Threat\n\nBitcoin's transaction signatures use ECDSA over the secp256k1 curve. Shor's quantum algorithm breaks this completely \u2014 not weakens, breaks \u2014 by solving the elliptic curve discrete logarithm in polynomial time. Every peer-reviewed paper in this corpus (22 total, spanning 2003\u20132026) confirms this. The canonical estimate is 2,330 logical qubits to extract a private key from a public key ([R\u00f6tteler et al., ASIACRYPT 2017](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-70697-9_9)). SHA-256 mining faces only Grover's quadratic speedup \u2014 a manageable weakening, not a break. These are different algorithms targeting different systems at different threat levels.\n\n## What's at Risk\n\nApproximately 1.72 million BTC (~$160\u2013190B at 2026 prices) sits in P2PK addresses with permanently exposed public keys \u2014 including Satoshi Nakamoto's estimated 1.1 million BTC, attributed via Sergio Demian Lerner's Patoshi analysis and corroborated by [Arkham Intelligence](https://platform.arkintelligence.com/explorer/entity/satoshi-nakamoto) at 1.096M BTC. An additional ~4.49 million BTC in reused P2PKH addresses faces long-range risk. These public keys are already recorded on-chain; no protocol change retroactively protects them.\n\n## How Far Away\n\nThe gap between current hardware (approximately 1,000\u20134,000 physical qubits) and attack capability (approximately 13 million physical qubits for a 1-day attack per [Webber et al. 2022](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/physics/iqt/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Webber-2022.pdf)) is 4\u20136 orders of magnitude. Expert timelines range from \"within a decade\" ([Project Eleven](https://projecteleven.com/), [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf)) to \"20\u201340 years\" ([Adam Back / Blockstream](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinshares-says-only-10-200-170531015.html)). Algorithmic improvements have reduced physical qubit requirements by ~20\u00d7 every six years; a repeat of Gidney's 2025 reduction would bring the attack into range of near-term hardware roadmaps.\n\n## The State of Play\n\nBIP-360 (P2MR output type by Hunter Beast) merged into the BIP repository in February 2026 \u2014 Bitcoin's first formal step. But no Bitcoin Core implementation PR exists. No consensus on which post-quantum signature scheme to adopt. No agreement on legacy UTXO handling. The most influential Core developers do not currently treat this as a live engineering priority. Even the optimistic path requires ~7 years from consensus to full migration ([Forbes / Heilman, February 2026](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/)).\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nThe threat is real and well-characterized. The timeline is uncertain but plausibly within a decade. The migration path is long and politically difficult. Multiple sources \u2014 including the [JBBA paper (December 2025)](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) and [Chaincode Labs report](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) \u2014 identify governance, not cryptography, as the primary bottleneck. The \"do nothing\" position, held by credible voices including Adam Back and Pieter Wuille, argues the threat is decades away and premature action risks locking in suboptimal choices. The \"prepare now\" position, held by Hunter Beast, Ethan Heilman, and Chaincode Labs, argues migration timelines measured in years cannot wait for a threat measured in years.\n\n---\n\n**Read next:** [SYNTHESIS.md](./SYNTHESIS.md) for the full 7,000-word analysis.

  "10-synthesis/SYNTHESIS": "# The Quantum Threat to Bitcoin: A Comprehensive Synthesis\n\n\n> **Last updated:** February 28, 2026 | **Confidence shelf-life:** 6 months (depends on all other sections)\n\n\n*Compiled: February 28, 2026*  \n*Source corpus: 28 files, ~75,500 words, covering academic research (2003\u20132026), protocol proposals, hardware roadmaps, key participants, and community debate*  \n*This document draws exclusively on claims and sources documented in the accompanying corpus. No claims are introduced from outside that material.*\n\n---\n\n## A Note on This Document\n\nThis synthesis follows the evidence. Where sources disagree \u2014 on timelines, on the scale of exposure, on which cryptographic scheme Bitcoin should adopt \u2014 it presents each side's strongest documented argument without resolving the dispute in favor of either. The corpus contains genuine intellectual disagreement among credentialed participants, and this document treats that disagreement as data, not as noise to be edited out.\n\nOne distinction is observed throughout: **[peer-reviewed]** marks claims sourced from journals, conference proceedings, and NIST-standardized publications; **[blog/industry]** marks claims from company reports, Substack posts, forum discussions, and media analyses. Both types of source are cited; neither is treated as automatically authoritative or dismissible.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Threat in Plain English (With Numbers)\n\nBitcoin's security rests on two mathematical pillars: the digital signatures that authorize spending, and the SHA-256 proof-of-work that orders the ledger. These pillars face quantum computing threats of radically different severity.\n\n### Shor's Algorithm: A Complete Break of ECDSA\n\nBitcoin's transaction authorization uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) over the secp256k1 curve. The security of this system depends on the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) \u2014 given a public key Q and generator G, find the private key d such that Q = d\u00b7G. On classical computers, this requires approximately O(2^128) operations for a 256-bit curve, placing it beyond classical reach.\n\nPeter Shor's 1994 quantum algorithm reduces discrete logarithm problems \u2014 including the ECDLP \u2014 to polynomial time via quantum period-finding. For Bitcoin's secp256k1, this reduces the attack from roughly 3.4\u00d710^38 classical operations to a polynomial number of quantum gate operations. As [Project Eleven's technical analysis](https://blog.projecteleven.com/posts/shors-algorithm-for-discrete-logs) explains, an attacker uses Shor's algorithm to solve Q = d\u00b7G for d given public knowledge of Q and G, then uses d to construct a valid ECDSA signature spending any funds associated with that public key. The transaction looks valid to every node on the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe canonical logical qubit estimate for this attack comes from **R\u00f6tteler, Naehrig, Svore, and Lauter (Microsoft Research, 2017)** [peer-reviewed]: breaking ECDSA-256 requires approximately **2,330 logical qubits** using optimized quantum circuits for elliptic curve point addition, with the full algorithm requiring ~1.26\u00d710^11 Toffoli gates ([R\u00f6tteler et al., ASIACRYPT 2017](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-70697-9_9)). This figure is confirmed across the literature and cited by the [Chaincode Labs report (October 2025)](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf), [Nature Scientific Reports (2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10873342/), and the [Murmuration II analysis (November 2025)](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-and-the-quantum-problem-part-47f). A 2025 preprint by Gu et al. [preprint] refined this upward to approximately 4,300 logical qubits under more realistic 2D architectural constraints ([Gu et al. 2025](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/caf8e5bc54e841ffd4e1b771e050525a0fb80469)), while Gheorghiu and Mosca (2019) [preprint] estimated 1,500 logical qubits for the same target. The range reflects different error-correction models and architectural assumptions, not scientific dispute about the fundamental attack.\n\n**Physical qubit requirements** are substantially larger. **Webber et al. (University of Sussex / Universal Quantum, 2022)** [peer-reviewed] calculated the physical qubit requirements at various time constraints ([Webber et al., AVS Quantum Science](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/physics/iqt/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Webber-2022.pdf)):\n\n| Time Budget | Physical Qubits Required |\n|---|---|\n| 10 minutes (mempool window) | ~1.9 billion |\n| 1 hour | ~317 million |\n| 1 day | ~13 million |\n\nAs the [CoinShares report (February 2026)](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/) [blog/industry] contextualizes: \"Breaking secp256k1 within one day requires ~13 million physical qubits \u2014 about 100,000 times more than the largest current quantum computer.\" The world's largest quantum processors contain approximately 1,000\u20134,000 physical qubits as of early 2026 \u2014 4 to 6 orders of magnitude short of even the most achievable attack scenario.\n\nEvery paper in the academic literature reviewed for this corpus \u2014 22 in total \u2014 agrees on the fundamental theoretical point: Shor's algorithm, on a sufficiently capable fault-tolerant quantum computer, breaks ECDSA completely. The debate is entirely about when such a computer will exist, not whether the attack is valid.\n\n### Grover's Algorithm: A Meaningful but Manageable Weakening of SHA-256\n\nBitcoin's proof-of-work uses SHA-256. Grover's algorithm provides a **quadratic** speedup for searching unstructured spaces \u2014 reducing SHA-256's effective preimage resistance from 256 bits to 128 bits. This is not a break: 2^128 \u2248 3.4\u00d710^38 operations remains practically infeasible, as [Chainalysis (November 2025)](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/quantum-computing-crypto-security/) [blog/industry] and the [CoinShares report (February 2026)](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/) both confirm. The [National Academies of Sciences (2019)](https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/25196/chapter/6) [peer-reviewed] concluded that Grover-based mining attacks \"would make the attack a nonthreat to the current Bitcoin ecosystem\" given circuit depth requirements and difficulty adjustment compensation.\n\n**This distinction is critical and frequently confused in public discourse.** Shor's algorithm is a polynomial-time break of ECDSA \u2014 a qualitative change that makes the problem tractable. Grover's algorithm is a quadratic speedup against SHA-256 \u2014 a reduction that leaves Bitcoin's mining security far above any practical attack threshold. These are different algorithms, different targets, and radically different threat levels. [Bitcoin Magazine's analysis](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-is-not-quantum-safe-and-how-we-can-fix-1375242150) states plainly: \"It is the easy challenge of cracking elliptic curve cryptography with Shor's algorithm that is the bottleneck\" \u2014 Grover's impact on hash functions is a manageable secondary concern.\n\nAggarwal et al. (2017, *Ledger*) [peer-reviewed] formally proved that Bitcoin's proof-of-work is substantially more quantum-resistant than its signature scheme, and Kiayias et al. (2023, *Quantum*) [peer-reviewed] provided formal theoretical grounding for this asymmetry ([Kiayias et al.](https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2023-03-09-944)).\n\n### The Attack Chain\n\nThe practical attack on a Bitcoin UTXO proceeds: (1) obtain the public key from on-chain data or the mempool; (2) run Shor's ECDLP circuit to extract the private key; (3) construct and broadcast a valid spending transaction to an attacker-controlled address. As the [Chaincode Labs report](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) summarizes: \"an attacker can use a quantum-derived private key to steal Bitcoin by creating and broadcasting a valid transaction that spends the victim's UTXOs to an address they control.\" Bitcoin nodes have no mechanism to distinguish a legitimate spend from a quantum-forged one.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What's Already at Risk\n\nThe quantum threat to Bitcoin is not uniform across its UTXO set. It is concentrated in specific address types where public keys are permanently visible on-chain, and modulated by how long a CRQC would need to run to complete an attack.\n\n### Address Vulnerability Classification\n\nThe [Chaincode Labs report](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) formalizes two attack vectors: **long-range attacks** targeting public keys permanently exposed on-chain (no time pressure), and **short-range attacks** targeting keys briefly visible during a transaction's mempool window (~10 minutes).\n\n**P2PK addresses** \u2014 Bitcoin's original output format used through 2009\u20132012 \u2014 embed the full public key directly in the locking script. These are immediately and permanently vulnerable. Approximately **1.72 million BTC** (~8.68% of total supply) sits in P2PK outputs, per [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf). Only ~67 new P2PK UTXOs have been created in the past 2.5 years; the format is effectively deprecated.\n\n**P2TR (Taproot) addresses**, Bitcoin's most recent upgrade (November 2021), embed a tweaked public key directly in the scriptPubKey. Despite being modern, these are immediately quantum-vulnerable \u2014 structurally similar to P2PK in terms of long-range exposure. Approximately **146,715\u2013196,292 BTC** resides in Taproot outputs, per [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf), [Checkonchain (December 2025)](https://newsletter.checkonchain.com/p/one-day-satoshis-coins-will-move), and [BitMEX Research / Dune Analytics (February 2026)](https://dune.com/murchandamus/bitcoins-utxo-set).\n\n**Reused P2PKH/P2WPKH addresses** \u2014 any address that has been spent from exposes its public key permanently on the blockchain. Address reuse \"transforms script types that would normally only be vulnerable to short-range attacks into ones that are vulnerable to long-range attacks,\" per [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf). Approximately **4.49 million BTC** in reused addresses is at risk, representing 69% of the total vulnerable exposure, driven primarily by exchange and institutional cold wallet address reuse, per [AInvest / Chaincode analysis (July 2025)](https://www.ainvest.com/news/bitcoin-news-today-32-7-bitcoin-supply-quantum-risk-address-reuse-exposes-6-36-million-btc-potential-attacks-2507/).\n\n**Unused P2PKH, P2WPKH, and P2WSH addresses** \u2014 where the public key has never been revealed \u2014 are not currently subject to long-range quantum attack. Their only quantum vulnerability is the brief ~10-minute window during which a spending transaction sits in the mempool, which requires approximately 1.9 billion physical qubits and is considered \"infeasible except in the very long term (decades)\" by [CoinShares (2026)](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/).\n\n### Total BTC at Risk: The Range of Estimates\n\nMultiple analyses have attempted to quantify total vulnerable Bitcoin. The estimates vary depending on what is counted:\n\n- **~1.9 million BTC** (P2PK + P2MS + P2TR, permanently exposed): [Checkonchain (December 2025)](https://newsletter.checkonchain.com/p/one-day-satoshis-coins-will-move)\n- **~6.26 million BTC** (~30% of supply): [Chaincode Labs (2025)](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf), including P2PK, P2TR, and all reused addresses\n- **~6.51 million BTC**: [Human Rights Foundation (October 2025)](https://hrf.org/latest/the-quantum-threat-to-bitcoin/)\n- **~6.89 million BTC**: [CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju (February 2026)](https://coingape.com/bitcoin-quantum-threat-ju-flags-risk-of-losing-satoshis-1m-btc-stash-to-hackers/)\n- **~10,200 BTC** (largest individual P2PK UTXOs only): [CoinShares (February 2026)](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/)\n\nThe CoinShares figure deserves particular attention because it represents a methodological counterargument, not a denial of the threat. Christopher Bendiksen argued in [the CoinShares report](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/) [blog/industry] that only coins in the largest P2PK UTXOs constitute \"near-term\" systemic risk, and that the higher figures conflate categories with different attack profiles. This is a legitimate methodological distinction. The Chaincode estimate includes address-reused coins that are vulnerable but whose owners retain their private keys and could migrate.\n\nThe most dangerous subset is coins that are both quantum-vulnerable **and** likely permanently lost \u2014 meaning no owner can migrate them regardless of advance warning. [Checkonchain (December 2025)](https://newsletter.checkonchain.com/p/one-day-satoshis-coins-will-move) estimates **2.08\u20132.63 million BTC ($187\u2013237 billion)** falls into this category \u2014 equivalent to 3 to 4 times Strategy's (formerly MicroStrategy's) corporate Bitcoin treasury.\n\n### Satoshi's Coins: The Quantum Honeypot\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto's estimated ~1.0\u20131.1 million BTC is held predominantly in P2PK addresses created in 2009\u20132010. This estimate originates from **Sergio Demian Lerner's \"Patoshi pattern\" analysis (2013, updated through 2019)**, which identified a distinctive ExtraNonce mining signature across approximately 22,000 early blocks attributable to a single dominant miner. [Arkham Intelligence (February 2026)](https://info.arkm.com/research/who-owns-the-most-bitcoin-top-btc-holders-2026) [blog/industry] corroborates this at 1.096 million BTC. A more conservative estimate from [BitMEX Research (2018)](https://blog.bitmex.com/satoshis-1-million-bitcoin/) [blog/industry] places the figure at 600,000\u2013700,000 BTC, arguing some Patoshi-attributed blocks may belong to other early miners. The credible range is therefore **~600K\u20131.1M BTC**, with the upper end more widely cited.\n\nNo Satoshi coins have moved since 2010. The overwhelming probability is that the private keys are inaccessible. This means these coins cannot be migrated to quantum-safe formats by their owner \u2014 making the only available options protocol-level intervention (freeze, burn) or accepting their eventual theft.\n\n[CoinTelegraph's analysis (November 2025)](https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:16fb594d6094b:0-what-happens-to-satoshi-s-1m-bitcoin-if-quantum-computers-go-live/) captures the market implications: \"If a hostile actor were the first to reach Q-Day, the simple act of moving Satoshi's coins would serve as proof of a successful attack. It would instantly show that Bitcoin's fundamental security had been broken, triggering market-wide panic, a bank run on exchanges and an existential crisis for the entire crypto ecosystem.\"\n\nThe Satoshi coin question has no clean resolution. The community faces a binary choice: accept the risk of eventual quantum theft (violating property rights of the original holder and destabilizing the market), or implement a protocol-level freeze or burn (violating Bitcoin's principle of immutable property rights). [Pieter Wuille](https://www.weex.com/news/detail/in-the-face-of-the-quantum-threat-bitcoin-core-developers-have-chosen-to-ignore-it-346468) (as cited in [Lopp's blog post, March 2025](https://blog.lopp.net/against-quantum-recovery-of-bitcoin/)), who co-authored both SegWit and Taproot, has stated: \"Of course they have to be confiscated. If and when the existence of a cryptography-breaking QC becomes a credible threat, the Bitcoin ecosystem has no other option.\" [Peter Todd](https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/0cc71aac9218942a1674fa25990c37a1@dtrt.org) has taken the opposite view, calling any keypath spend disabling \"extremely confiscatory.\"\n\n---\n\n## 3. How Far Away Is This?\n\nCurrent quantum hardware is orders of magnitude short of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) for Bitcoin. Understanding the gap requires distinguishing between where hardware is today and where published roadmaps project it will be.\n\n### The Current Hardware Gap\n\nAs of early 2026, the world's leading quantum systems include:\n\n- **Google Willow**: 105 physical qubits. December 2024's landmark achievement was demonstrating **below-threshold quantum error correction** \u2014 as qubit array size increases, error rates decrease rather than accumulate ([Nature, December 2024](https://phys.org/news/2024-12-google-quantum-chip-error.html)). This is a necessary but not sufficient precondition for a CRQC. [CoinShares](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/) contextualizes: \"Breaking secp256k1 in one hour requires 3 million times better than current quantum computers [Willow's 105 qubits].\"\n- **Quantinuum Helios**: 98 physical qubits / **48 logical qubits** (November 2025). The world record for demonstrated logical qubits. In June 2025, Quantinuum demonstrated the [first universal, fully fault-tolerant quantum gate set](https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/06/27/quantinuum-crosses-key-quantum-error-correction-threshold-marks-turn-from-nisq-to-utility-scale/), achieving magic state fidelity of 5.1\u00d710^-4.\n- **IonQ**: Demonstrated **>99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity** in October 2025 ([PostQuantum.com](https://postquantum.com/quantum-research/ionq-record-2025/)), surpassing all previous records.\n- **IBM**: 120-qubit Nighthawk processor (2025). IBM's most detailed public roadmap targets ~200 logical qubits (Starling, 2029) and ~2,000 logical qubits (Blue Jay, 2033), per [PostQuantum.com IBM analysis](https://postquantum.com/quantum-computing-companies/ibm/) and [Tom's Hardware (February 2026)](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/the-future-of-quantum-computing-the-tech-companies-and-roadmaps-that-map-out-a-coherent-quantum-future).\n\nThe best publicly demonstrated logical qubit count (48, Quantinuum Helios) is approximately **50\u00d7 short** of the canonical 2,330 logical qubit threshold for breaking ECDSA-256.\n\n### Published Roadmaps and the Bitcoin Threshold\n\nIBM's Blue Jay (2033, ~2,000 logical qubits) is the most discussed near-term hardware projection relative to Bitcoin. As [Murmuration II (November 2025)](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-and-the-quantum-problem-part-47f) [blog/industry] notes: \"IBM itself predicts that their Blue Jay system expected in 2033 will run circuits of 1 billion gates and 2,000 logical qubits \u2014 enough to break ECC256.\" However, 2,000 logical qubits falls just below the canonical 2,330 threshold; whether Blue Jay actually crosses it depends on final algorithmic optimization and error correction performance. IBM itself targets a **12:1 physical-to-logical qubit ratio** using LDPC codes at 99.99% gate fidelity \u2014 achievable, per [PostQuantum.com](https://postquantum.com/quantum-computing-companies/ibm/), by their 2029 Starling timeline.\n\nIonQ's public roadmap targets 8,000 logical qubits by 2029, which would far exceed the threshold \u2014 but this is among the industry's most ambitious projections, contingent on multiple unproven scaling steps, per [Tom's Hardware (February 2026)](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/the-future-of-quantum-computing-the-tech-companies-and-roadmaps-that-map-out-a-coherent-quantum-future).\n\n**A critical and often overlooked trend**: resource requirements for quantum cryptanalysis have fallen dramatically through algorithmic improvements. Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney's May 2025 paper reduced the estimated physical qubit requirement for breaking RSA-2048 to **under one million physical qubits** \u2014 a **20\u00d7 reduction from his own 2019 estimate** of 20 million qubits, per [The Quantum Insider (May 2025)](https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/05/24/google-researcher-lowers-quantum-bar-to-crack-rsa-encryption/) [blog/industry]. This trend of consistent algorithmic improvement means that projections based on 2022 or earlier resource estimates are systematically too pessimistic about when a CRQC could emerge.\n\n### Why Experts Disagree on Timeline\n\nTimeline estimates for a CRQC span more than a decade and reflect genuine uncertainty, not bad faith. The range from credentialed technical sources includes:\n\n- **As early as 2027**: Aggarwal et al. (2017/2018) [peer-reviewed] identified this as a lower bound; Dallaire-Demers et al. (2025) project \"first intersections\" between rising quantum capabilities and falling resource requirements \"between 2027 and 2033,\" per [Murmuration II](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-and-the-quantum-problem-part-47f).\n- **~2030 (39% probability)**: Kalshi prediction markets, cited by [Citi Institute (January 2026)](https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/Citi_Institute_Quantum_Threat.pdf) [blog/industry].\n- **~2034 (median)**: Metaculus prediction platform, per [BeInCrypto (November 2025)](https://beincrypto.com/quantum-computing-cryptography-timeline-2034/).\n- **2035 (federal deprecation deadline)**: [NIST's IR 8547 (December 2024)](https://pqshield.com/nist-recommends-timelines-for-transitioning-cryptographic-algorithms/) mandates full system transition by 2035, implying expectation of viable CRQC by mid-2030s.\n- **19\u201334% probability by 2034, 60\u201382% by 2044**: Global Risk Institute / [Citi Institute](https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/Citi_Institute_Quantum_Threat.pdf).\n- **~20\u201340 years**: Adam Back, Blockstream CEO, per [Phemex (November 2025)](https://phemex.com/news/article/adam-back-bitcoin-can-counter-quantum-threats-with-softforks-39152).\n- **Not within this decade**: Michael Saylor ([Coin Stories, February 2026](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC2iQsy2_vI)), Webber et al. (2022) [peer-reviewed].\n\nThe key uncertainties are: error correction scaling (whether \"below threshold\" demonstrated at 105 qubits can be maintained at millions of qubits), the pace of physical gate fidelity improvements, and whether algorithmic improvements will continue to reduce the logical qubit threshold. The intelligence dimension also cannot be dismissed: as [Hunter Beast noted at MIT Bitcoin Expo 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TsVRZeyiAY), the NSA's CNSA 2.0 timeline (sunsetting EC/RSA in new systems by 2030) implies institutional awareness of a closer threat horizon than publicly acknowledged.\n\n**ECDSA-256 is easier to break than RSA-2048.** [Proos & Zalka (2003)](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301141) [peer-reviewed] established that 160-bit ECC requires fewer qubits than comparable RSA; [R\u00f6tteler et al.](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-70697-9_9) confirmed this at the 256-bit level. A CRQC for Bitcoin will arrive before one sufficient to break most RSA-protected internet infrastructure \u2014 meaning RSA-based timeline estimates are upper bounds for the Bitcoin threat.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The \"Do Nothing\" Scenario\n\nThe question of what happens if Bitcoin does not upgrade its cryptography has been analyzed directly by several sources. The answer is not speculative: it follows directly from the technical parameters established above.\n\n### The \"Do Nothing\" Position and Its Strongest Advocates\n\nThe strongest version of the \"do nothing\" position is not that quantum computers are impossible or that ECDSA is safe \u2014 virtually no technically credentialed participant claims either. The strongest version is:\n\n1. **The threat is decades away**, providing ample time for gradual upgrade when the technical picture is clearer. This is the position of **Adam Back** (Blockstream CEO): \"Probably not for 20\u201340 years, if then. And there are quantum secure signatures, NIST standardized SLH-DSA last year. Bitcoin can add over time, as the evaluation continues and be quantum ready, long before cryptographically relevant quantum computers arrive,\" per [Phemex (November 2025)](https://phemex.com/news/article/adam-back-bitcoin-can-counter-quantum-threats-with-softforks-39152).\n2. **Premature action is more dangerous than the threat itself**. Bitcoin developer **James O'Beirne** argued on [Stephan Livera Podcast SLP721 (February 2026)](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/721/) that quantum discourse is being \"weaponized as a wedge to introduce new, unvetted cryptography into Bitcoin,\" and that \"quantum doesn't breach the top hundred things when it comes to Bitcoin.\" **Michael Saylor** stated that \"the crypto community will be the first to perceive the threat, and to react,\" per [Coin Stories (February 2026)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC2iQsy2_vI).\n3. **Bitcoin can respond when the threat becomes concrete**. Both Back and Saylor argue that when a CRQC becomes imminent, the community will mobilize and act \u2014 and that there is no need to pay the significant costs of quantum resistance until that moment.\n\nThis position has substantial institutional support. **Pieter Wuille**, who wrote both SegWit and Taproot and is widely considered the most technically influential active Bitcoin Core developer, stated in February 2025: \"I certainly agree that there is no urgency at present,\" per [WEEX analysis](https://www.weex.com/news/detail/in-the-face-of-the-quantum-threat-bitcoin-core-developers-have-chosen-to-ignore-it-346468). **Peter Todd** and **Luke Dashjr** have both explicitly denied the practical relevance of near-term quantum risk. The [Murmurations II survey (February 2026)](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-developers-are-mostly-not) [blog/industry] found that virtually all of Bitcoin's top-tier Core maintainers treat quantum as \"theoretical, distant, or speculative, not a live engineering problem.\"\n\n### The Cost of Inaction: Modeled Scenarios\n\nThe [gap analysis in this corpus](../07-timeline-and-risk/gap-analysis.md), drawing on the [Chaincode Labs report](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) and the [JBBA hybrid PQ paper (December 2025)](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf), models three scenarios for what \"do nothing\" leads to:\n\n**If T_quantum arrives ~2033\u20132035 and T_migration reaches completion ~2037\u20132040 (Narrow Gap scenario, ~40\u201350% probability):** A 2\u20137 year window exists during which approximately 4\u20135 million BTC remain vulnerable as migration progresses. At current prices, this represents $400\u2013600 billion at risk. The [Citi Institute](https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/Citi_Institute_Quantum_Threat.pdf) estimated that a quantum attack on a single major financial institution could trigger $2\u20133.3 trillion in indirect economic damage; Bitcoin's systemic exposure compounds this.\n\n**If T_quantum arrives ~2030\u20132033 and governance stalls (Wide Gap scenario, ~20\u201330% probability):** A 7\u201312 year gap exists. The [JBBA paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) explicitly models this as the \"Most Likely Outcome\" under current governance dynamics: \"Stalls indefinitely until a quantum computer is demonstrated.\" If this occurs, Bitcoin faces emergency migration under adversarial conditions \u2014 massive fee spikes, governance crisis, and the Satoshi coin decision made under extreme time pressure.\n\n**If T_quantum arrives by ~2028\u20132030 (Catastrophic scenario, ~5\u201310% probability):** Even the \"best-case\" 7-year migration timeline begun today would leave approximately 6.26\u20136.51 million BTC unreprotected.\n\nAcross all scenarios, the [corpus gap analysis](../07-timeline-and-risk/gap-analysis.md) concludes: \"a **positive gap \u2014 a meaningful risk window \u2014 is the most probable outcome** under current trajectories.\" This is not an advocacy claim \u2014 it follows from the arithmetic of T_quantum minus T_migration under the most likely values for each variable.\n\nThe Chaincode Labs report calculates that UTXO migration would require **76 to 568 days** of block space, depending on allocation and whether STARK compression is available. This is the physical minimum \u2014 not contingent on governance consensus, which historically takes far longer.\n\n\"Harvest now, decrypt later\" (HNDL) further complicates the \"wait and see\" position: adversaries can and presumably do record all on-chain P2PK public keys today, awaiting future quantum capability. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, UK NCSC, ENISA, and the Australian Cyber Security Centre all base their PQC guidance on the assumption that adversaries are currently collecting cryptographic material for future decryption, per [Freshfields (December 2025)](https://technologyquotient.freshfields.com/post/102lx4l/quantum-disentangled-1-harvest-now-decrypt-later-the-quantum-threat-is-alr).\n\n---\n\n## 5. The Solution Landscape\n\nNIST finalized three post-quantum signature standards in August 2024, providing the first standardized PQ cryptography suitable for deployment. They differ dramatically in their properties and suitability for Bitcoin.\n\n### The Three NIST-Standardized Schemes\n\n**ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FIPS 204)** [peer-reviewed / NIST standard]: NIST's \"primary recommendation for general use.\" A lattice-based scheme using the Fiat-Shamir with aborts paradigm over Module-LWE/SIS. Key properties: 2,420-byte signatures (38\u00d7 ECDSA's 64 bytes), 1,312-byte public keys (41\u00d7 ECDSA's 32 bytes), very fast verification using only integer arithmetic, and straightforward constant-time implementation with no floating-point arithmetic. Combined public key + signature: ~3,732 bytes (~38\u00d7 ECDSA). An ML-DSA transaction is estimated to reduce Bitcoin block throughput from ~2,500\u20133,000 transactions to ~90\u2013130 without a witness discount change, per [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf). The UTXO set would expand from ~5 GB to approximately ~296 GB if fully migrated, per the [JBBA hybrid paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf). A Bitcoin-specific challenge: **BIP-32 HD wallet compatibility issues** were identified on the bitcoin-dev mailing list by developer Conduition, as ML-DSA's algebraic structure does not support hierarchical deterministic key derivation in the same way as secp256k1. Seck & Roux-Langlois (2025, *IACR Communications in Cryptology*) [peer-reviewed] proposed DilithiumRK as a solution with BIP-32 compatibility ([Seck & Roux-Langlois](https://doi.org/10.62056/ak5wom2hd)).\n\n**SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+, FIPS 205)** [peer-reviewed / NIST standard]: The only non-lattice-based NIST finalist signature scheme. Security reduces entirely to SHA-256 preimage resistance \u2014 the same assumption Bitcoin's proof-of-work already depends on. This \"hash-only\" security assumption is its primary advantage: adopting SLH-DSA adds no new cryptographic assumptions to Bitcoin. Stateless operation (no key-reuse tracking required) makes it compatible with Bitcoin's seed-phrase recovery model. But signatures are very large: **7,856 bytes for the smallest parameter set (SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s)** \u2014 123\u00d7 ECDSA's 64 bytes. A standard Bitcoin block with SPHINCS+ signatures would hold only ~100 transactions, a 98% reduction in throughput, per [Garima Singh's analysis (January 2026)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/post-quantum-migration-blockchain-existential-threat-garima-singh-x9gof). The public key, at just 32 bytes, is comparably sized to ECDSA.\n\n**FN-DSA (FALCON-512, FIPS 206 \u2014 draft August 2025)** [NIST draft standard, not yet finalized]: The most compact NIST-selected scheme. Average ~666-byte signatures, 897-byte public keys, combined ~1,563 bytes (~16\u00d7 ECDSA). FALCON's compactness makes it attractive for Bitcoin's block space constraints. However, it has significant implementation risks: Gaussian sampling requires floating-point arithmetic, creating **6\u20138\u00d7 performance variation** based on hardware FPU availability, per the [JBBA hybrid paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf). Side-channel attacks via timing and power analysis are documented risks. Signatures are variable-length (617\u2013809 bytes depending on sampling), complicating fee estimation. FIPS 206 finalization is expected **late 2026 or early 2027**, per [DigiCert (September 2025)](https://www.digicert.com/blog/quantum-ready-fndsa-nears-draft-approval-from-nist) \u2014 meaning no production deployment should occur before then.\n\n### Scheme Properties Compared\n\n| Scheme | Signature | Public Key | Combined | vs ECDSA | Security Assumption |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| secp256k1 ECDSA (baseline) | 64B* | 33B | 97B | 1\u00d7 | ECDLP (broken by Shor's) |\n| FN-DSA-512 (FALCON) | ~666B avg | 897B | ~1,563B | ~16\u00d7 | NTRU lattice |\n| ML-DSA-44 (Dilithium) | 2,420B | 1,312B | 3,732B | ~38\u00d7 | Module-LWE/SIS |\n| SLH-DSA-128s (SPHINCS+) | 7,856B | 32B | 7,888B | ~81\u00d7 | SHA-256 preimage |\n\n*Sources: [NIST FIPS 204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final), [NIST FIPS 205](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final), [libbitcoinpqc GitHub](https://github.com/cryptoquick/libbitcoinpqc)*\n\n### FALCON vs. Dilithium: The Central Tradeoff\n\nThe choice between FALCON and Dilithium is the most practically contested scheme selection question. FALCON offers ~5\u00d7 smaller signatures but at significant implementation cost: complexity, hardware dependency, side-channel risk, variable size, and delayed standardization. Dilithium is simpler, safer to implement, and already in FIPS production \u2014 but imposes 38\u00d7 rather than 16\u00d7 block space overhead. Both are lattice-based; both rest on hardness assumptions younger than SHA-256. Neither is the clear winner for Bitcoin.\n\nThe emerging consensus among Bitcoin Core-adjacent developers \u2014 particularly **Matt Corallo** and **Jonas Nick** \u2014 is that **hash-based schemes should be Bitcoin's first PQ deployment**. Corallo stated on [Stephan Livera Podcast SLP719 (February 2026)](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/719/): \"I think right now the only thing to do would be to add hash-based signatures in Bitcoin.\" His reasoning: \"post-quantum schemes are still fairly young\" \u2014 hash-based security is the most battle-tested assumption in cryptography. This view is corroborated by the [Chaincode Labs report](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf), which recommends hash-based schemes for conservative initial deployment, and by [BitMEX Research (July 2025)](https://www.bitmex.com/blog/quantum-safe-lamport-signatures) [blog/industry], which argued that hash-based schemes should be preferred because \"Bitcoin could use hash functions for everything, mining proof of work and signatures, making Bitcoin more simple.\" BitMEX's Part 2 (January 2026) further proposed a \"quantum Taproot\" type with disabled key-path and dual tapleaf spend paths (quantum-safe + quantum-vulnerable), allowing users to upgrade wallets immediately while continuing to use efficient classical signatures until QDay, per [BitMEX Research](https://www.bitmex.com/blog/Taproot-Quantum-Spend-Paths) [blog/industry].\n\n### The Aggregation Gap\n\nNone of the NIST-standardized PQ schemes support native non-interactive signature aggregation \u2014 a significant disadvantage compared to BLS signatures (used in Ethereum's proof-of-stake). This means each Bitcoin transaction must carry its full PQ signature on-chain, with no batching advantage.\n\nThe most ambitious proposed mitigation is **Non-Interactive Transaction Compression (NTC) via STARKs**, proposed by BIP-360 co-author Ethan Heilman in [April 2025](https://www.ethanheilman.com/x/32/index.html): miners compress all PQ signatures in a block into a single STARK proof, reducing per-transaction signature overhead to approximately 2 bytes per input and potentially enabling ~87 transactions/second (versus Bitcoin's current ~7 TPS), per [Delving Bitcoin NTC discussion](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/post-quantum-signatures-and-scaling-bitcoin-with-starks/1584). The Ethereum Foundation has a working prototype for this approach; it has not been demonstrated in a Bitcoin context. The [JBBA paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) estimates \"10\u00d7 compression possible\" but classifies this as \"concept only, no prototypes\" with a 5\u20137 year R&D timeline.\n\n### SHRINCS: A Bitcoin-Specific Research Proposal\n\nIn December 2025, **Jonas Nick (Blockstream Research)** published SHRINCS on [Delving Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/shrincs-324-byte-stateful-post-quantum-signatures-with-static-backups/2158), proposing a hybrid hash-based scheme combining unbalanced XMSS (stateful, efficient primary path) with SPHINCS+ (stateless fallback for seed restoration). For the first spend from a key (the most common use case), SHRINCS achieves approximately **324-byte signatures** \u2014 11\u00d7 smaller than ML-DSA-44. [Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #391 (February 2026)](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2026/02/06/) summarized: \"SHRINCS offers a compromise where a stateful signature is used when the fidelity of the key+state can be known with certainty, but falls back to stateless signing at higher cost if there is doubt.\" SHRINCS remains research-stage with a formal BIP expected at OPNEXT 2026 (April 16, 2026).\n\n---\n\n## 6. The State of Proposals and Code\n\n### BIP-360: Pay-to-Merkle-Root (P2MR)\n\n**BIP-360** was merged into the official Bitcoin BIP repository on **February 11, 2026**, authored by Hunter Beast, Ethan Heilman, and Isabel Foxen Duke, per [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/bitcoin-advances-toward-quantum-resistance) and [Forbes (February 2026)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/). This is a significant milestone and a critically important one to characterize precisely.\n\n**What BIP-360 is:** A new SegWit v2 output type (scriptPubKey: `OP_2 <32-byte-merkle-root>`, addresses starting `bc1z`) that commits only to a Merkle root of the script tree, **completely removing the Taproot keypath spend**. Because no public key is embedded in the scriptPubKey, P2MR addresses are not vulnerable to long-range quantum attacks. The BIP requires BIPs 340, 341, and 342 as dependencies and is backward-compatible \u2014 legacy nodes treat P2MR outputs as anyone-can-spend, identical to how P2TR appeared to pre-Taproot nodes.\n\n**What BIP-360 is not:** A BIP repository merge \"doesn't imply consensus, adoption, or that the idea is even good,\" per the repository's own disclaimer, as cited by [CryptoSlate (February 2026)](https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-devs-merge-new-plan-to-limit-quantum-exposure-risk-but-you-pay-in-fees-and-privacy/). BIP-360 **introduces no post-quantum signature scheme** \u2014 it creates the structural foundation onto which PQ signature opcodes will be grafted in follow-on BIPs. It addresses long-exposure attacks but **explicitly does not protect against short-exposure mempool attacks**, as [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/) noted: \"BIP 360 does not address the short-exposure attack: the risk that a computer could derive a private key from a key during the brief period a transaction remains in the mempool before confirmation.\"\n\n**No Bitcoin Core implementation PR exists as of February 2026.** The [Chaincode Labs analysis](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) concluded that all Bitcoin PQ initiatives \"remain at an early and exploratory stage.\" A [LinkedIn analysis (February 2026)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/6-massive-challenges-bitcoin-faces-road-quantum-security-jlenc) observed: \"BIP-360 has increased its chances of activation by not implementing a signature scheme\" \u2014 acknowledging that the simpler output type faces lower governance hurdles than a full algorithm commitment.\n\n### Pieter Wuille's Objection and Developer Caution\n\n**Tim Ruffing** (Blockstream Research, co-author of Taproot's BIP-340) raised substantive concerns about BIP-360's multi-algorithm approach on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, per [the February 2025 BIP-360 update thread](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/9d6f01ca-9fab-4638-b59b-64db6301c2dbn@googlegroups.com/T/): \"I am not quite convinced that adding three PQ schemes to the Bitcoin consensus protocol is a great solution to the problem of not being sure which exact scheme to pick. Offloading this decision to users does not really solve this problem. Moreover, this adds massive complexity and new cryptographic assumptions to the protocol.\" This is not a rejection of quantum preparedness, but a substantive technical objection to the multi-scheme architecture. Ruffing simultaneously co-authored important positive research: his July 2025 paper proved that Taproot's hidden script paths remain quantum-secure even if Schnorr is broken, enabling the \"commit now, activate later\" approach championed by Matt Corallo, per [Blockstream Q3 2025 update](https://blog.blockstream.com/blockstream-quarterly-update-q3-2025/).\n\n**Pieter Wuille's** position \u2014 \"no urgency at present\" \u2014 does not translate to opposition to BIP-360. Rather, it reflects a view that the activation process can proceed on a non-emergency timeline. His documented statement that vulnerable coins \"have to be confiscated\" if a CRQC materializes indicates acceptance of the ultimate necessity of quantum hardening; the disagreement with urgency advocates is about **when** that necessity is triggered.\n\n### The Zero-PRs-to-Core Finding\n\nThe corpus documents a crucial asymmetry: extensive research and BIP-level specification work, but no implementation pull request to Bitcoin Core. The active repositories listed in the corpus include [libbitcoinpqc](https://github.com/cryptoquick/libbitcoinpqc) (the BIP-360 cryptographic primitives library), [BTQ's Bitcoin Quantum Core](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/btq-technologies-launches-bitcoin-quantum-testnet-302658425.html), and [QBlockQ/pqc-bitcoin](https://github.com/QBlockQ/pqc-bitcoin) \u2014 but none of these represent a Bitcoin Core implementation PR. The [Chaincode Labs paper](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) summarized this situation plainly: all Bitcoin PQ work \"remain at an early and exploratory stage, with much of the preliminary research still occurring informally and privately.\"\n\n### Related Proposals\n\n**Matt Corallo's OP_SPHINCS proposal** (January 2025): Add an OP_SLHDSA (or equivalent) opcode to tapscript, allowing wallets to embed a PQ signature as a hidden Taproot script leaf today \u2014 at zero current cost \u2014 and activate it later via soft fork. Per [Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #335](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/01/03/) and [Stephan Livera SLP719](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/719/).\n\n**Tadge Dryja's transitory soft fork** (December 2024, January 2025): A temporary restriction on quantum-insecure ECDSA/Schnorr signatures with a \"proof-of-quantum-computer\" (PoQC) on-chain trigger. If an actor fulfills an on-chain puzzle solvable only with a quantum computer, the restriction becomes permanent; otherwise it can lapse. Per [Bitcoin Optech #335](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/01/03/).\n\n**Jameson Lopp's three-phase migration BIP** (July 2025): Phase A (soft fork prohibiting new quantum-vulnerable outputs), Phase B (deadline after which legacy ECDSA/Schnorr spends from vulnerable UTXOs become invalid), and optional Phase C (ZK proof of BIP-39 seed ownership for recovery \u2014 likely requiring a hard fork). Co-authored with Christian Papathanasiou, Ian Smith, Joe Ross, Steve Vaile, and Pierre-Luc Dallaire-Demers; submitted to [bitcoin-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/uEaf4bj07rE). Reception was sharply divided; Tim Ruffing called the proposal premature.\n\n**BTQ Technologies' Bitcoin Quantum testnet** (launched January 12, 2026): The only live demonstration of a working quantum-resistant Bitcoin-compatible network, using ML-DSA (FIPS 204) with **64 MiB blocks** to accommodate the larger signatures, per [PR Newswire (January 2026)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/btq-technologies-launches-bitcoin-quantum-testnet-302658425.html). The 64 MiB block size \u2014 16\u00d7 Bitcoin's current effective limit \u2014 is, as the corpus notes, \"politically untenable on Bitcoin mainnet.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. The Debate and Its Fault Lines\n\nThe Bitcoin quantum resistance debate comprises at least five overlapping controversies. Participants' positions on each tend to cluster: timeline beliefs cascade into urgency assessments, which drive scheme selection preferences and legacy UTXO policy.\n\n### The Urgency Spectrum\n\nMapped from most to least alarmed, with documented positions:\n\n**Urgency advocates (CRQC within 2\u201310 years):** Charles Edwards (Capriole Investments), \"within two to eight years\" at TOKEN2049, per [Daily Hodl (October 2025)](https://dailyhodl.com/2025/10/15/bitcoin-faces-quantum-computing-threat-in-just-2-8-years-warns-charles-edwards/). Ethan Heilman (MIT DCI / BIP-360): \"I firmly believe that Bitcoin must transition to post-quantum signatures in the near future,\" per [WEEX analysis](https://www.weex.com/news/detail/in-the-face-of-the-quantum-threat-bitcoin-core-developers-have-chosen-to-ignore-it-346468). Nic Carter (Castle Island): risk \"sufficiently advanced that it's no longer reasonable to deride as mere FUD,\" per [Tech.eu (June 2025)](https://tech.eu/2025/06/19/project-eleven-secures-6m-for-quantum-resistant-bitcoin-security/). Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum): ~20% probability CRQC by 2030, per [DL News (February 2026)](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/vitalik-proposes-quantum-roadmap-for-ethereum/).\n\n**\"Within a decade\" camp (moderate):** Matt Corallo (Bitcoin Core / Spiral): \"10, 15 years, when a cryptographically relevant quantum computer is kind of more imminent,\" per [Stephan Livera SLP719](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/719/). Chaincode Labs: \"CRQCs could arrive within the next decade,\" from [chaincode.com](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf). Jameson Lopp: 50% probability within 4\u20139 years, per [key-researchers.md](../06-people-and-orgs/key-researchers.md).\n\n**Skeptics (decades away):** Adam Back (Blockstream CEO): \"probably not for 20\u201340 years, if then,\" per [Phemex (November 2025)](https://phemex.com/news/article/adam-back-bitcoin-can-counter-quantum-threats-with-softforks-39152). Pieter Wuille: \"no urgency at present,\" per [WEEX](https://www.weex.com/news/detail/in-the-face-of-the-quantum-threat-bitcoin-core-developers-have-chosen-to-ignore-it-346468). Michael Saylor: \"not a this-decade thing,\" per [Coin Stories (February 2026)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC2iQsy2_vI). Peter Todd and Luke Dashjr: explicitly dismiss practical relevance, per [Murmuration II](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-developers-are-mostly-not).\n\n### The Satoshi Coins Fault Line\n\nThis debate recurs at every level of the corpus. The question of what to do with ~1.1 million BTC in permanently exposed, likely-lost P2PK addresses is inseparable from deeper values about Bitcoin's purpose:\n\n**The property-rights position:** CoinShares' Christopher Bendiksen: burning or freezing vulnerable UTXOs is \"fundamentally contradictory to Bitcoin's principles,\" per [CoinShares (February 2026)](https://coinshares.com/us/insights/research-data/quantum-vulnerability-in-bitcoin-a-manageable-risk/). Peter Todd: disabling keypath spends is \"extremely confiscatory,\" per [bitcoin-dev (December 2024)](https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/bitcoindev/0cc71aac9218942a1674fa25990c37a1@dtrt.org). Tim Ruffing: \"pre-burning coins for something that may never happen\" is the wrong direction, per [WEEX analysis](https://www.weex.com/news/detail/in-the-face-of-the-quantum-threat-bitcoin-core-developers-have-chosen-to-ignore-it-346468).\n\n**The systemic risk position:** Jameson Lopp: \"Quantum recovered coins only make everyone else's coins worth less. Think of it as a theft from everyone,\" per [Lopp blog (March 2025)](https://blog.lopp.net/against-quantum-recovery-of-bitcoin/). Pieter Wuille \u2014 despite his \"no urgency\" timeline position \u2014 has stated coin confiscation is the only option if a CRQC materializes: \"Of course they have to be confiscated,\" as cited in [Lopp's blog post (March 2025)](https://blog.lopp.net/against-quantum-recovery-of-bitcoin/).\n\nThis is a fault line that cannot be bridged by technical analysis. It turns on competing values about property rights and systemic risk management.\n\nHowever, [BitMEX Research (February 2026)](https://www.bitmex.com/blog/Mitigating-The-Impact-Of-The-Quantum-Freeze) [blog/industry] proposed a potential middle ground: a freeze accompanied by multiple recovery methods. Four schemes were outlined: (1) Commitment Recovery (hash commitment + 100-block reveal), (2) Seed Phrase Commitment (exploiting the quantum-safe PBKDF2/SHA-512 step in BIP-39 derivation), (3) Pre-QDay Commitment (a Merkle root committed before QDay \u2014 applicable to Satoshi's coins), and (4) STARK-based ZKP Seed Phrase Method (no advance preparation required, reusable). BitMEX concluded that combining these methods could make \"almost every quasi frozen coin potentially recoverable.\" The key technical insight: BIP-39's word-to-seed derivation is quantum-safe, meaning seed phrase knowledge constitutes a quantum-safe proof of ownership even after a CRQC breaks ECDSA. The ZKP method is particularly significant because it requires no advance preparation \u2014 users can continue normal wallet usage until the freeze, then simply upgrade to include STARK proofs. Only P2PK coins created before the seed phrase era (including much of Satoshi's ~1.1M BTC), where no pre-QDay commitment was made, would remain truly unrecoverable. A comprehensive UTXO table from [Dune Analytics / murchandamus](https://dune.com/murchandamus/bitcoins-utxo-set) published in the article showed P2PK at 1,716,419 BTC (8.6%) and Taproot at 196,292 BTC (1.0%), with ~90.5% of Bitcoin supply having access to all recovery methods.\n\n### Blockstream's Internal Tension\n\nAn organizationally notable phenomenon documented in the corpus: **Blockstream's CEO (Adam Back) and Blockstream Research (Jonas Nick, Tim Ruffing, Mikhail Kudinov) hold notably different public positions on urgency.**\n\nAdam Back has been consistently dismissive of near-term quantum risk, calling it 20\u201340 years away and characterizing urgency advocates as making \"uninformed noise,\" per [Yellow.com (December 2025)](https://yellow.com/news/bitcoin-quantum-debate-escalates-between-blockstream-ceo-and-castle-island-vc). Meanwhile, Blockstream Research has been among the most productive teams on quantum preparedness: Jonas Nick co-developed SHRINCS (December 2025), Tim Ruffing proved Taproot's quantum security properties (July 2025), and the team co-authored the \"Hash-based Signature Schemes for Bitcoin\" report (December 2025), per [Blockstream Q4 2025 update](https://blog.blockstream.com/blockstream-quarterly-update-q4-2025/). The [organizations profile](../06-people-and-orgs/organizations.md) describes Blockstream's organizational position as \"Technically cautious but actively researching\" with \"the CEO's public skepticism creat[ing] an internal tension with the research team's output.\" This tension is documented, not inferred.\n\n### The Primary Bottleneck: Governance, Not Engineering\n\nThe [JBBA hybrid PQ paper (December 2025)](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf) reaches a conclusion that most corpus sources converge on: the primary bottleneck is governance, not engineering. \"Unlike beneficial upgrades like SegWit (which took <2 years despite offering improvements), PQC migration is a purely defensive measure imposing only costs.\" Historical precedent is sobering: SegWit was proposed December 2015 and activated August 2017 \u2014 less than two years, but at the cost of the block size wars that nearly split the network. Taproot succeeded relatively smoothly because it offered tangible benefits. PQ migration imposes \"50\u201370% throughput reduction and 2\u20133\u00d7 fee increases\" with zero immediate user benefit.\n\nHunter Beast captured this precisely at [MIT Bitcoin Expo 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TsVRZeyiAY): \"Quantum is a technical problem. Migration is a human one. Unless we prepare before we need it, Bitcoin's greatest risk isn't that quantum breaks the cryptography, it's that we won't be able to move fast enough when it does.\"\n\nThe [Murmurations II survey](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/bitcoin-developers-are-mostly-not) documented that the most technically influential developers \u2014 the ones whose approval any Bitcoin Core PR requires \u2014 do not currently view quantum as a live engineering priority. As [FuTu News analysis](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/69055174/) concluded: \"without their approval, any upgrade to Bitcoin will fail.\"\n\n---\n\n## 8. What Would Need to Happen\n\nFor Bitcoin to achieve meaningful quantum resistance before a CRQC arrives, a specific sequence of actions must occur. Based on the corpus analysis, this sequence is:\n\n### Step 1: Community Consensus on a Signature Scheme (0\u20132 years from now)\n\nThe most urgent unresolved technical question is which PQ signature scheme Bitcoin will adopt. Without this decision, BIP-360's Phase 2 (PQ signature opcodes) cannot be specified. The candidate space has narrowed to: SHRINCS (Jonas Nick / Blockstream, hash-based, ~324 bytes), SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+, hash-based, 7,856 bytes), ML-DSA (Dilithium, lattice, 2,420 bytes), and FN-DSA (FALCON, lattice, ~666 bytes, standardization pending). Matt Corallo has expressed a preference for hash-based schemes; BIP-360's libbitcoinpqc implements all three NIST schemes. No consensus exists. OPNEXT 2026 (April 16) will feature Jonas Nick's OP_SHRINCSVERIFY presentation \u2014 a potential inflection point, per [organizations.md](../06-people-and-orgs/organizations.md).\n\n### Step 2: Bitcoin Core Implementation PR for BIP-360 (1\u20133 years)\n\nBIP-360's merge into the BIP repository is documentation, not code. A Bitcoin Core implementation PR must be filed, reviewed, and merged before any network activation is possible. Ethan Heilman estimated 2.5 years for code review and testing, per [Forbes (February 2026)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2026/02/23/bitcoin-took-its-first-step-against-quantum-computers/). This is the next concrete milestone.\n\n### Step 3: Soft Fork Activation of BIP-360 + PQ Signature Opcode (6\u201318 months for activation signaling, following implementation)\n\nActivation requires miner signaling (or an alternative mechanism not yet specified for BIP-360) and broad node operator support. Based on Taproot's precedent \u2014 ~17 months from BIP finalization to activation \u2014 this phase takes roughly one to two years under favorable conditions. Per [bitcoin-migration-timeline.md](../07-timeline-and-risk/bitcoin-migration-timeline.md).\n\n### Step 4: Ecosystem Migration (3\u20137+ years)\n\nHardware wallet manufacturers, exchanges, custodians, and end users must upgrade their software and migrate their UTXOs. Ethan Heilman's \"optimistic\" estimate: \"In an optimistic scenario, 90% of participants will have completed the update five years after activation,\" per [Phemex (February 2026)](https://phemex.com/news/article/bitcoins-postquantum-upgrade-may-take-7-years-warns-bip-360-coauthor-61263). The long tail \u2014 Satoshi's P2PK coins, lost hardware wallets, dormant institutional cold storage \u2014 may never migrate without a protocol-level intervention.\n\n**Total optimistic timeline: 7 years from today (~2033), assuming immediate consensus.** This is Ethan Heilman's estimate. The [Chaincode Labs report](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf) recommends a **dual-track approach**: deploy a minimally viable PQ output type within 2 years as an emergency contingency, while pursuing the comprehensive 7-year path in parallel.\n\n### External Catalysts That Could Accelerate Action\n\nSeveral external events could shift Bitcoin's governance dynamics:\n\n- **A demonstrable quantum hardware milestone** (IBM Starling reaching ~200 logical qubits in 2029, or IonQ crossing 1,600 logical qubits) that makes the CRQC timeline concretely visible\n- **Regulatory pressure** from the U.S. DoD's 2030 quantum-readiness deadline, NSA CNSA 2.0 requirements, or equivalent international mandates cascading to ETF custodians (BlackRock, Fidelity) and exchanges (Coinbase, which has already convened an \"Independent Advisory Board on Quantum Computing and Blockchain,\" per [Cybernews (February 2026)](https://cybernews.com/crypto/bitcoin-will-become-quantum-resistant-when-it-solves-a-human-problem/))\n- **An on-chain theft of dormant P2PK coins** that provides observable proof of a CRQC attack and triggers emergency governance mobilization\n- **Kevin O'Leary's institutional pressure scenario**: O'Leary disclosed in February 2026 that quantum computing risks are \"preventing institutions from allocating more than 3%\" to Bitcoin, per [multiple sources](https://x.com/TheDustyBC/status/2023661191378465045) \u2014 suggesting bottom-up institutional pressure is already measurable\n\nThe [JBBA paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/154321-hybrid-post-quantum-signatures-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-a-protocol-level-integration-strategy.pdf)'s \"Most Likely Outcome\" assessment is stark: Bitcoin stalls until a quantum computer is demonstrated. Tadge Dryja's \"transitory soft fork\" with PoQC trigger is designed for exactly this scenario \u2014 providing a pre-built emergency mechanism that can activate without requiring prior community consensus on timing, per [Bitcoin Optech #335](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/01/03/).\n\n---\n\n## 9. The Unresolved Questions\n\nThe following questions remain genuinely open in the corpus as of February 28, 2026. They are not rhetorical \u2014 they are the load-bearing uncertainties on which billions of dollars and years of protocol work depend.\n\n**On cryptography:**\n- Which post-quantum signature scheme will Bitcoin adopt? No formal selection process exists and no consensus has formed between hash-based (SHRINCS/SLH-DSA, favored by Corallo and Nick) and lattice-based (ML-DSA/FN-DSA, favored by BTQ Technologies and BIP-360's libbitcoinpqc library) camps\n- Can STARK-based signature compression (NTC/NIWA) be demonstrated to work in Bitcoin's context? No proof-of-concept exists as of February 2026\n- Will FALCON's Gaussian sampling side-channel issues be resolved in a constant-time implementation suitable for consensus-critical code?\n- Are Module-LWE/SIS (ML-DSA) and NTRU (FALCON) assumptions sufficiently battle-tested for Bitcoin's 50-year security horizon? They have ~15\u201325 years of cryptanalytic attention vs. SHA-256's 25+ years\n- Could algorithmic breakthroughs reduce the logical qubit threshold below current estimates, accelerating the threat timeline?\n\n**On governance:**\n- What will Bitcoin do with Satoshi's ~1.1 million BTC in P2PK addresses \u2014 freeze, burn, or allow theft?\n- Will the \"do nothing\" camp among Core developers passively block BIP-360 activation through inertia?\n- What activation mechanism will BIP-360 use, and will it achieve the necessary miner/node support?\n- Will the witness discount conflict \u2014 any PQ opcode requires a witness discount increase that echoes the block size wars \u2014 be navigated without another governance crisis?\n\n**On hardware:**\n- Will IBM Blue Jay (2033, ~2,000 logical qubits) actually achieve its specifications on schedule, and will algorithmic improvements bring the CRQC threshold below that level?\n- Are classified quantum capabilities \u2014 particularly from nation-state programs \u2014 already ahead of published roadmaps?\n- Is \"harvest now, decrypt later\" already actively targeting Bitcoin's 38,157 P2PK addresses?\n\n**On the ecosystem:**\n- Can BIP-32 HD wallet compatibility with ML-DSA be solved before activation, enabling hardware wallet manufacturers to begin implementation?\n- Will Lightning Network's quantum exposure \u2014 channel scripts with embedded public keys \u2014 be addressed alongside base-layer migration?\n\n---\n\n## 10. Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin faces a genuine, well-characterized, and time-constrained cryptographic threat. Every major academic analysis reviewed in this corpus \u2014 22 peer-reviewed papers spanning 2003 to 2026 \u2014 agrees that Shor's algorithm, on a sufficiently capable fault-tolerant quantum computer, completely breaks Bitcoin's ECDSA signature scheme. No paper disputes this theoretical conclusion. The debate is entirely about when such a computer will exist and how long Bitcoin's migration will take.\n\nThe current hardware gap is real and substantial: the best publicly demonstrated logical qubit count is 48 (Quantinuum Helios, November 2025), approximately 50\u00d7 short of the 2,330 logical qubits required to attack ECDSA-256. IBM's 2033 Blue Jay roadmap targets ~2,000 logical qubits \u2014 near but not clearly over the threshold. IonQ's roadmap targets 8,000 logical qubits by 2029 if all milestones are met. Algorithmic improvements have consistently reduced physical qubit requirements by approximately 20\u00d7 every six years; a repeat of Craig Gidney's 2025 reduction would bring the attack within reach of near-term hardware. These are documented technical facts, not advocacy.\n\nThe exposure is also real and substantial. Approximately 1.72 million BTC in P2PK addresses has permanently visible public keys \u2014 including Satoshi's estimated 1.1 million BTC, which has not moved in 15+ years and is presumed lost. An additional 4.49 million BTC in reused P2PKH addresses is at long-range risk. These coins are \"already harvested\" in the cryptographic sense \u2014 their public keys are permanently recorded and any future CRQC operator can extract the private keys at will. No protocol change retroactively protects them.\n\nBitcoin has, as of February 2026, taken its first formal step: BIP-360 merged into the BIP repository, providing the output type infrastructure needed for future PQ signature opcodes. No Bitcoin Core implementation PR has been filed. The community has not reached consensus on which signature scheme to adopt, how to handle the witness discount, or what to do about legacy vulnerable UTXOs. The most technically influential developers \u2014 those whose approval any Bitcoin Core PR requires \u2014 do not currently view quantum as a live engineering priority.\n\nThe governance challenge is, by the analysis of multiple sources including the JBBA paper [peer-reviewed via *Journal of the British Blockchain Association*] and the Chaincode Labs report, the primary bottleneck \u2014 more than the cryptography. Ethan Heilman's \"optimistic\" estimate is 7 years from consensus to full migration. The JBBA paper's \"most likely outcome\" is that Bitcoin stalls until a quantum computer is publicly demonstrated. These two timelines are not the same as Bitcoin's probability distribution over outcomes.\n\nThe question this synthesis cannot answer \u2014 because no participant in the debate has answered it with evidence rather than assertion \u2014 is whether Bitcoin's governance will mobilize before a CRQC arrives. That question turns on social dynamics, institutional pressure, hardware milestones, and the timing of potential breakthroughs that are inherently uncertain. What the corpus establishes is the shape of the risk: approximately $500\u2013650 billion in potentially vulnerable Bitcoin, a migration timeline measured in years not months, and a hardware trajectory that places the threat window between the early 2030s and mid-2040s depending on which projections one weights most heavily.\n\nHunter Beast's motto for BIP-360 \u2014 \"prepared, not scared\" \u2014 captures the moderate position that most credentialed technical participants converge on: the threat is real, the preparation is necessary, the timeline provides some room for careful rather than panicked action, and the cost of waiting too long exceeds the cost of beginning now. The community's actual behavior relative to that position will determine the outcome.\n\n---\n\n*End of synthesis document.*  \n*This document cites only claims and sources documented in the accompanying corpus.

This does not make their technical claims wrong, but it creates a structural bias worth flagging: urgency is good for their businesses. In the opposite direction, Adam Back (Blockstream CEO) publicly dismisses the threat while his company maintains ECDSA-based Bitcoin infrastructure, and Michael Saylor \u2014 holding 717,722 BTC \u2014 has enormous financial incentive to characterize quantum risk as distant. CoinShares manages Bitcoin investment products and publishes the most conservative exposure estimate (10,200 BTC at real risk) while explicitly framing the threat as \"manageable.\" The pattern holds across the spectrum: participants with financial skin in the game cluster predictably around positions that benefit their holdings. The clearest exceptions \u2014 those most credibly free of commercial distortion \u2014 are the academic and non-profit voices: MIT DCI (Heilman, Dryja), Chaincode Labs (Milton/Shikhelman), and independent Core contributors such as Corallo, who takes a moderate \"prepare but don't panic\" position with no identifiable financial stake in the outcome.\n\n**The Blockstream internal tension is the most analytically significant anomaly in the debate.** Adam Back, as CEO, has been the single loudest dismissive voice \u2014 calling urgency advocates \"uninformed noise\" and putting the threat at \"20\u201340 years, if then.\" Yet his own organization's research team has produced more original quantum-resistance work than any other entity in the Bitcoin ecosystem: Tim Ruffing published the formal proof of Taproot's post-quantum security; Jonas Nick and Mikhail Kudinov designed SHRINCS (the most compact hash-based scheme proposed to date) and proposed OP_SHRINCSVERIFY; and Blockstream Research co-authored the comprehensive \"Hash-based Signatures for Bitcoin\" report. Nic Carter has publicly argued that Back's \"uninformed noise\" characterization \"undermines the credibility\" of his own researchers' output. The most plausible interpretation is that Back's public posture serves a different function than his research program: the public statements manage market sentiment and customer confidence in existing ECDSA-based products, while the internal research hedges against the scenario where the threat is real. This split between institutional messaging and technical output makes Blockstream's researchers (Nick, Ruffing, Kudinov) among the most credible voices on the technical merits, precisely because their work runs counter to their CEO's public narrative.\n\n**Timeline skepticism among Core developers correlates with governance conservatism, not technical incompetence.** Pieter Wuille, the single most technically authoritative figure in Bitcoin protocol development, is genuinely skeptical of near-term urgency \u2014 yet he has also stated clearly that if a CRQC materializes, \"the ecosystem has no other option\" than freezing quantum-vulnerable coins. Peter Todd and Luke Dashjr are more dismissive. The pattern here is not ignorance but ideology: Core's dominant epistemology is \"show me the concrete evidence before activating a change.\" This is a principled position in a system where premature upgrades are costly and irreversible. The danger is structural: Bitcoin's evidence-first governance norm creates a potential gap between when a credible quantum threat is detectable and when the network could complete a migration \u2014 a gap that Chaincode Labs estimates at 7\u201310 years. Even if every skeptic immediately converted to urgency advocates the moment a CRQC was proven, the migration timeline would already be determined by the work not yet started. This asymmetry between detection time and response time is the core argument of the urgency camp \u2014 and it is one that the \"no urgency\" camp's own timeline estimates don't fully refute.\n\n---\n\n*Cross-references: [key-researchers.md](../06-people-and-orgs/key-researchers.md) | [organizations.md](../06-people-and-orgs/organizations.md) | [debate-map.md](../06-people-and-orgs/debate-map.md) | [conference-talks.md](../08-community-sentiment/conference-talks.md) | [notable-threads-and-posts.md](../08-community-sentiment/notable-threads-and-posts.md)*\n\n*Compiled: February 28, 2026 | Scope: All named individuals and organizations with documented positions as of the corpus compilation date.
